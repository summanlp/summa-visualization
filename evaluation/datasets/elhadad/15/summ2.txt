A summary of the physical basis of quantum computation appeared last week in " Science " magazine . In it David Vencenzo points out that " It is evident from this survey of the current state of the art in quantum experimental physics that the construction of quantum computers is presently in the most rudimentary stage , and that to even think about a procedure like Shor factorization , which might require millions of operations on thousands of qubits , might be absurdly premature .
Nevertheless , there are some useful things to think about in quantum computation from the perspective of the construction of consciousness .
He points out that this algorithm can be implemented on an analog computer , but " do not worry: more subtle uses of quantum interference cannot be explained away so easily with classical thinking. " The Church - Turing Thesis says that the meaning of " effective computation " is equivalent to " all computations that can be performed by a Universal Turing Machine " . Church 's Thesis says that the meaning of " effective computation " is equivalent to " all computations that can be programmed in Church 's lambda calculus " . The BlumShubSmale model is constructed over any ring , including both integers and reals .
