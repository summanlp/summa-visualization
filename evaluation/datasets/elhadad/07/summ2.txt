Water on the moon In a cavern , in a canyon . Such romantics have always hoped against hope that there might be some corner of the moon where water - - or , at least , ice - - did linger .

The crater in question is the Aitkin basin , at the moon 's south pole .

In 1994 this area was probed with radar by Clementine , a scientific spacecraft unusual in that she was built by America 's Department of Defence , rather than the civilian National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( though NASA scientists have been heavily involved ) . Clementine 's mission was to test a set of optical instruments developed for the " Star Wars " strategic defence initiative of the 1980s . Ice and rock reflect radio waves differently .
