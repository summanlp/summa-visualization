Water on the moon In a cavern , in a canyon . Such romantics have always hoped against hope that there might be some corner of the moon where water - - or , at least , ice - - did linger . Their best chance was that it might be found in some deep crater where the sun never shines and the temperature is therefore so low that ice would not evaporate .
In 1994 this area was probed with radar by Clementine , a scientific spacecraft unusual in that she was built by America 's Department of Defence , rather than the civilian National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( though NASA scientists have been heavily involved ) . Ice and rock reflect radio waves differently . Nearby areas exposed to the sun 's rays , and similar areas at the moon 's north pole , looked , as expected , like bare rock .
