The genetic illusion WHAT is man ? Lately , however , philosophy has become rather less fashionable than genetics , which is in the throes of a hugely expensive effort , known as the Human Genome Project , to answer the same question . And , in the longer run , it is in danger of creating a philosophical misconception of its own: that men 's actions are determined by their genes , not by their own free will . Conversely , geneticists with particular points of view were not above making up results to support their own ideologies . The brains of homosexuals are different from those of heterosexuals . For " biology is destiny " carries a second , unspoken , premise: " genetics is biology " .

Does this make people prisoners of the way their brain is wired ?
