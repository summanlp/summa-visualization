The genetic illusion WHAT is man ? Lately , however , philosophy has become rather less fashionable than genetics , which is in the throes of a hugely expensive effort , known as the Human Genome Project , to answer the same question . Conversely , geneticists with particular points of view were not above making up results to support their own ideologies .
The respectable scientific case against free will is a physicist 's case - - that every outcome is an inevitable consequence of the arrangement of matter that immediately preceded it . For " biology is destiny " carries a second , unspoken , premise: " genetics is biology " . Men with a fault in the appropriate gene will be colourblind without exception . Brains are built and regulated by thousands of them .
Does this make people prisoners of the way their brain is wired ?
