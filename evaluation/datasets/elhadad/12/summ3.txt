A quantum computer would rely on the surreal behaviour of the very small to work miracles with information . Indeed , they are organised into " logic gates " that do calculations using this algebra .

The bits in a " quantum computer " would not , therefore , be ones or zeros . Dr Monroe 's group trapped a single ion ( an atom with missing electrons ) of beryllium , by walling it in with electric and magnetic fields and cooling it to within an ace of absolute zero ( - 273C ) . Why should DARPA , better known for researching missile defences and commissioning the precursor of the Internet , dabble in quantum theory ? Qubits , not being true bits , are not truly digital . One of the big advantages of recording and processing information digitally is that it is difficult to make a mistake ( electronic " ones " are not that easily turned into " zeros " ) , and surprisingly easy to design ways to recognise and correct any mistake that is made .
