A shortage of sirs TRYING to teach quadratic equations to a bunch of unruly teenagers is hardly the cushiest of jobs . So as unemployment continues to fall , it is not surprising that teacher - training colleges are finding it hard to recruit prospective maths teachers .

The government asked teacher - training colleges in England and Wales to recruit about 2,000 people to train as maths teachers this autumn .

Teaching is not the best - paid job , especially for those with degrees in maths and science . But it is not badly paid either .
