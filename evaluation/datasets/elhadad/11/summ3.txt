Hello , Dolly DOLLY is a lamb . As the first mammal to have been successfully ' cloned ` from the cells of an adult , she is the talk of the world . But it is not enough merely to register repugnance , without examining the cause of this emotion and testing its claim against the claims of reason . To throw up one 's hands in horror simply on the ground that cloning interferes with the natural order is to exaggerate the extent to which the natural order is desirable , and to under - estimate the extent to which man has already altered it , often with advantage . Much of this week 's alarm stems from a confusion about what a clone would be . Many people argue that in light of man 's proven propensity to abuse powerful technologies ( one Nobel laureate drew parallels this week with the nuclear bomb ) it would be folly to put this new one into the hands of future dictators who may harbour mad dreams of master races or custom - bred slaves . But this argument is not only impractical ( a tyrant would invent the technology if he wanted it ) ; it is an argument against technology in general . But there are ethical reasons why human cloning should not at present go ahead even in single cases . So why bother to dissent from the howl of protest that attended the advent of Dolly ?
