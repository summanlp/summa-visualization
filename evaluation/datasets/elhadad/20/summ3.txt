FOR several years , physicists , mathematicians and computer scientists have been worrying at the problem of how to make a quantum computer - - a device that would out - perform conventional ( or " classical " ) computers as thoroughly as conventional computers have beaten the abacus . It stores and shuffles binary numbers ( those containing only the digits 1 and 0, which it remembers as the " on " and " off " positions of tiny switches , or " bits " ) . They worked out that the same effect could be achieved by using the total opposite: a sea of molecules , jostling and tumbling like a band of excitable schoolchildren . A quantum computation usually gives a variable result which has to be corrected by a final , classical calculation .
