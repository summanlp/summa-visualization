A new class of drugs has brought the possibility that AIDS may now be a treatable disease . That is what many of the world 's AIDS researchers now believe they have done .

The immune system , the organ assaulted by HIV , is one of the most complicated in the body . Its cells ( known as lymphocytes ) grow and mature in bone marrow , and in a gland known as the thymus .

Anti - viral drugs , such as those in the newly developed cocktails , are designed to throw spanners into the reproductive works . They interfere with the defining peculiarity of retroviruses - - which is that , in order to get a host cell to pay attention to them , they must copy their RNA into DNA ( the usual currency in which genes are stored ) and then smuggle it into the host cell 's nucleus , where it can hide among the host genes and manipulate the cell 's operations . Stop this " reverse transcription " ( of RNA into DNA ) , and you stop the virus .

The new drugs , by contrast , clobber the virus after this , at the point where it sticks its nose out of its host 's nucleus and gets the cell 's machinery to start churning out new viral proteins . Yet both sorts of drug share the same underlying concept - - they jam the function of a crucial enzyme .

Dr Ho and Dr Shaw demonstrated that this theory was wrong . Most viruses evolve by one mutation at a time - - it is not easy for them to exchange genes , as many living organisms do , by having any form of sex .

There are also questions over what is known as the " bioavailability " of one of the drugs - - saquinavir .

The brain , therefore , may serve as a reservoir of last resort for the virus. ( Indeed , several researchers believe that the dementia suffered by some AIDS patients is nothing to do with the collapse of their immune systems , but is a direct effect of the virus on nerve cells ) .
