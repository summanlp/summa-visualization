A new class of drugs has brought the possibility that AIDS may now be a treatable disease . This means that their bodies can keep the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , the agent that causes the disease , at such low levels that it appears to do no harm .

The immune system , the organ assaulted by HIV , is one of the most complicated in the body . Its cells ( known as lymphocytes ) grow and mature in bone marrow , and in a gland known as the thymus .

Viruses are usually specialists , and HIV specialises in a type of lymphocyte known as a helper T - cell .

The nine genes from hell Viruses are tiny , which is one reason that they need so much help reproducing . Most viruses are made of DNA ( their genes ) and protein . Yet both sorts of drug share the same underlying concept - - they jam the function of a crucial enzyme . Most viruses evolve by one mutation at a time - - it is not easy for them to exchange genes , as many living organisms do , by having any form of sex .
