But whereas surgeons applauded when Health Care International ( HCI ) , a private hospital , announced this month that one of its doctors had invented an anaesthetic machine which means people feel much less sick after operations and speeds their recovery , reaction in Scotland was less than ecstatic .

This view might also have been thought by critics to be justified when Gavin Kenny , a professor of anaesthesia at Glasgow University , shifted his research team from Glasgow Royal Infirmary to HCI , lured by lavish facilities . But Mr Kenny 's move speeded up work on a machine which uses micro - computers to control the rate at which an anaesthetic is pumped into the blood of patients undergoing surgery .
