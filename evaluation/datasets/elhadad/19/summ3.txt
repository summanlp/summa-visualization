Breaking the brain barrier.No human organ is better protected against intrusive chemicals than the brain . So one way of sending drugs across the blood - brain barrier is by subverting a receptor into carrying them in , too . Dr Pardridge is able to make the receptor carry his drug , too , by using another protein , known as a monoclonal antibody , as a molecular roof - rack . By stuffing his drugs into balls of fat called liposomes , and attaching each liposome itself to a number of antibodies , he can get as many as 10,000 drug molecules across the barrier in one packet . In a paper just published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Science , he has shown that his " immunoliposomes " can successfully shuttle daunomycin into the brains of experimental rats up to 24 hours after they are injected into the rats ' bloodstreams .
Nor is the transferrin receptor the only one on which this sort of trick can be pulled . At Neuromedica , a drug - delivery firm based in Conshohockon , Pennsylvania , Victor Shashoua is studying the receptor that transports cis - docosahexaenoic acid or DHA a naturally - occurring fatty acid that forms a significant proportion of the brain 's grey matter - - across the blood - brain barrier . Now the trick is being recreated - - ironically to assist the passage of enkephalin , one of the family of neurotransmitters that heroin mimics in order to produce its effects . The blood vessels supplying gliomas - - malignant brain tumours which strike almost 200,000 Americans each year - - are more likely to leak than those in healthy brain tissue . Their weapon is RMP - 7, a bradykinin look - alike , which has been biochemically tailored to increase its stability and potency .
