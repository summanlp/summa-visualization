Breaking the brain barrier.No human organ is better protected against intrusive chemicals than the brain . That makes it difficult to treat with drugs . To keep the organ pure , a gatekeeper known as the blood - brain barrier screens any molecule that might try to gain access . So one way of sending drugs across the blood - brain barrier is by subverting a receptor into carrying them in , too . Dr Pardridge is able to make the receptor carry his drug , too , by using another protein , known as a monoclonal antibody , as a molecular roof - rack . Now the trick is being recreated - - ironically to assist the passage of enkephalin , one of the family of neurotransmitters that heroin mimics in order to produce its effects . The blood vessels supplying gliomas - - malignant brain tumours which strike almost 200,000 Americans each year - - are more likely to leak than those in healthy brain tissue . Their weapon is RMP - 7, a bradykinin look - alike , which has been biochemically tailored to increase its stability and potency .
