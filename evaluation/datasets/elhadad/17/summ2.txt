MOST people in Britain think that the National Health Service is on its knees . This view goes far to explain the Tories ' unpopularity: the NHS is the part of the welfare state that Britons care most about . Then , in health care , new technology tends to raise costs not lower them , because new treatments are usually dearer than old ones . Then the task will be to bring demand and supply into line .

The other approach , which would work best alongside charges , is to introduce a hypothecated health - care tax .
