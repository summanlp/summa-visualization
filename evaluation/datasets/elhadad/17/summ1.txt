How to pay for the NHS Britain 's health service is underfunded .

MOST people in Britain think that the National Health Service is on its knees . This view goes far to explain the Tories ' unpopularity: the NHS is the part of the welfare state that Britons care most about .

The Tories persist in arguing that all is well: since 1979 spending on health has risen from 25 billion to 43 billion at today 's prices . One course is to let the NHS wither , delivering an ever narrower set of services to an ever poorer clientele , as increasing numbers take up private medical insurance .

The other approach , which would work best alongside charges , is to introduce a hypothecated health - care tax .
