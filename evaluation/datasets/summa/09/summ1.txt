The 2014 FIFA World Cup has been one of the biggest social media events in the history. 
The amount of post, comments and likes made on Facebook and Twitter were huge.
The numbers are surprisingly big in the USA, one of the few nations where soccer isn't the most popular sport.
It is also remarkable that the US interest in the tourney didn't disappear when the American team lost to Belgium in the knockout round.
