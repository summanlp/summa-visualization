Despite that 2014 was an extremely good year for the American car industry, nine car models were discontinued.
In some cases, the models were discontinued due to low sales: four of these recorded less than 10,000 cars sold in 2003.
Some other models were cut off by their manufacturers in order to promote a more focused lineup of products.
The rest of the cars were removed for being just a niche product, or because they were hybrids that didn't provide a substancial fuel economy difference.
