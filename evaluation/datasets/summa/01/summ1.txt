Progressive rock band Rush has released a new conceptual album named Clockwork Angels.
The album is inspired in Voltaire's work, Candide, and in Neil Peart's own life experience in dealing with the tragic loss, using the basic skeleton of Candide to explore his own grief and optimism within the lyrics.
The sound of Clockwork Angels is more aggresive than others Rush's albums, showing the virtuosity of the musicians, but robbing the trio of some of their personality
The album has been produced by Nick Raskulinecz, who has introduced heavier sounds, in order to push the band to court younger fans.
