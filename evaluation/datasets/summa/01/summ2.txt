Canadian band Rush have released their 20th studio album, Clockwork Angels.
Drummer Neil Peart was influenced by Voltaire's most well known work, Candide, for the lyrical content of the record.
Clockwork Angels producer, Nick Raskulinecz, may account for the heavier sounds of the tracks and for creating one of the band's most aggressive albums.
The album can be easily digested by anyone looking for a good rock song, and although modern production techniques can sometimes steal Rush's personality, it can attract younger fans as well.
