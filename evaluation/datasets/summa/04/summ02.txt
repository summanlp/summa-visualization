Oracle remains the undisputed king of databases, but there was an explosion of new databases in the last few years.
Solid IT created an index, DB-Engines, which aims to determine to what extent these databases are actually being used.
According to the ranking, open source NoSQL database MongoDB grew the most, followed by the relational database PostgreSQL.
The suprise third spot went to Cassandra, a low buzz NoSQL database developed in 2008 with big name users such as Netflix and eBay.
