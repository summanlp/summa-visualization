Hackers have destroyed a video game starring Kim Jong Un called Glorious Leader!
Hackers sympathetic to the Kim regime are suspected of having conducted the attack.
Data pertaining to the game and other projects were damaged, and the developers had been locked out of their computers and website.
North Korea analysts are, in turn, concerned about becoming the next target, as their websites have been exposed to attacks.
