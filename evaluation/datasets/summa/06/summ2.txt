While standarized tests aim to measure how much students are learning, in practice they just make them develop test-taking skills.
Teachers are not free to build a custom lesson plan, limiting the ability of students to learn.
The current method does not prepare students for higher education because it does not teach analytical thinking.
Standarized testing also results hugely stressful, leading students to bad eating, sleeping and study habits, which in turn lead to lower scores.
