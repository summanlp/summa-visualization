Java 8, the new version of the programming languaje Java was oficially released today.
This update has been in the works since 2010, and it's the first major update since the release of Java 7 in July 2011.
Java 8 includes some features such as Lambda expressions, which extend the programming model to the modern era of cloud deployments.
According to MuleSoft's James Donelan, this new version could represent a real benefit for the users because of its improvements.
Nevertheless, Donelan regretted that the key Project Jigsaw was dropped for the release.
