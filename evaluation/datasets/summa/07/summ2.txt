The euro is falling fast against the dollar, and it shouldn't be long before the two are worth the same.
In general, currencies go up when monetary policy is tight, and down when it's loose.
The US economy is stronger than Europe's: the former's Federal Reserve will increase interest rates shortly, while Europe is still stuck in a depression.
So, markets think the US is going to tighten monetary policy and Europe is going to loosen it, which has sent the dollar up and the euro down.
