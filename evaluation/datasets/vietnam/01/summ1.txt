Hurricane Andrew, the costliest disaster to hit the US, has helped the re- election campaign of President Bush. After a faltering initial response, the administration is getting assistance to the hurricane's victims. Earlier the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the ultimate Republican patronage backwater, was caught completely unprepared by Andrew. Now the Transportation Secretary and Chief of Staff have jumped in to fill the breach. The president has dispatched troops to Florida, promised to rebuild Homestead Air Force Base, and has committed the government to pay the emergency relief costs. The latest polls show Bush closing the gap in his campaign for re-election.
