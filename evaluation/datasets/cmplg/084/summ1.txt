We   present  an    integrated architecture   for
  word-level   and  sentence-level processing  in  a unification-based
  paradigm. The  core  of the system  is  a  CLP implementation  of  a
  unification  engine   for feature  structures  supporting relational
  values.   In this framework   an HPSG-style grammar is implemented.
  Word-level   processing uses    X2MORF, a morphological  component
  based  on    an extended version    of  two-level  morphology.  This
  component is tightly integrated with the grammar as a relation.  The
  advantage of  this approach is that morphology  and syntax  are kept
  logically autonomous while at the   same time minimizing   interface
  problems.
