Current approaches to computational lexicology in language technology
are knowledge-based (competence-oriented) and try to abstract away
from specific formalisms, domains, and applications. This results in
severe complexity, acquisition and reusability bottlenecks.  As an
alternative, we propose a particular performance-oriented approach to
Natural Language Processing based on automatic memory-based learning
of linguistic (lexical) tasks.  The consequences of the approach for
computational lexicology are discussed, and the application of the
approach on a number of lexical acquisition and disambiguation tasks
in phonology, morphology and syntax is described.
