In this paper, we present an alternative approach to multiple inheritance
for typed feature structures.
In our
approach, a feature structure can be associated with several types coming
from different hierarchies (dimensions). In case of multiple inheritance, a
type
has supertypes from different hierarchies. We contrast this approach
with approaches based on a single type hierarchy where a feature structure
has only one unique most general type, and multiple inheritance
involves computation of greatest lower bounds in the hierarchy.
The proposed approach supports current linguistic
analyses in constraint-based formalisms like HPSG, inheritance in
the lexicon, and knowledge representation for NLP systems. Finally,
we show that multi-dimensional inheritance hierarchies can be
compiled into a Prolog term representation, which allows to compute
the conjunction of two types efficiently by Prolog term unification.
