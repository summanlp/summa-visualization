Tableaux originate as a decision method for a logical language.
They can also be extended to obtain a structure that
spells out all the information in a set of sentences in terms of
truth value assignments to atomic formulas that appear in them.
This approach is pursued here.  Over such a structure,
compositional rules are provided for obtaining the
presuppositions of a logical statement from its atomic subformulas
and their  presuppositions.
The rules are based on classical logic semantics
and they are shown to model the  behaviour of presuppositions
observed in natural language sentences built with
if ...then, and and or.
The advantages of this method  over existing
frameworks for presuppositions are discussed.
