This paper is an attempt to bring together two approaches to
  language analysis. The possible use of probabilistic
  information in principle-based grammars and parsers is considered,
  including discussion on some theoretical and computational problems
  that arise. Finally a partial implementation of these ideas is
  presented, along with some preliminary results from testing on a
  small set of sentences.
