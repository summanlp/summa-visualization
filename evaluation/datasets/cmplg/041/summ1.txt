Experiments were carried out comparing the Swedish Teleman and the
English Susanne corpora using an HMM-based and a novel reductionistic
statistical part-of-speech tagger. They indicate that tagging the
Teleman corpus is the more difficult task, and that the performance of
the two different taggers is comparable.
