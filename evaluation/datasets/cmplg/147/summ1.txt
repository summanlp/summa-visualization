In this paper, we assess the complexity results of
formalisms that describe the
feature theories used in computational linguistics.
We show that from these complexity results
no immediate conclusions can be drawn about the complexity of
the recognition
problem of unification grammars using these feature
theories.
On the one hand, the complexity of feature
theories does not provide an upper bound for the complexity
of such unification grammars.
On the other hand, the complexity of feature
theories need not provide a lower bound.
Therefore, we argue for formalisms that describe
actual unification grammars instead of feature theories.
Thus the complexity results of these formalisms
judge upon the hardness of unification
grammars in computational linguistics.
