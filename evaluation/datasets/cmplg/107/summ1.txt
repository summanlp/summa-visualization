In this paper we present a semantic study of motion complexes (ie. of
   a motion verb followed by a spatial preposition). We focus on the
   spatial and the temporal intrinsic semantic properties of the motion
   verbs, on the one hand, and of the spatial prepositions, on the other
   hand. Then we address the problem of combining these basic semantics
   in order to formally and automatically derive the spatiotemporal
   semantics of a motion complex from the spatiotemporal properties
   of its components.
