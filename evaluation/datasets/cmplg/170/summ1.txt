Both anaphora resolution and prepositional phrase (PP) attachment are
the most frequent ambiguities in natural language processing.  Several
methods have been proposed to deal with each phenomenon separately,
however none of proposed systems has considered the way of dealing
both phenomena. We tackle this issue here, proposing an algorithm to
co-ordinate the treatment of these two problems efficiently, i.e., the
aim is also to exploit at each step all the results that each
component can provide.
