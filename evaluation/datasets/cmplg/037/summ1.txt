A discourse strategy is a strategy for communicating with another
agent.  Designing effective dialogue systems requires designing agents
that can choose among discourse strategies. We claim that the design
of effective strategies must take cognitive factors into account,
propose a new method for testing the hypothesized factors,
and present experimental results on an effective strategy for
supporting deliberation. The proposed method of computational dialogue
simulation provides a new empirical basis for computational
linguistics.
