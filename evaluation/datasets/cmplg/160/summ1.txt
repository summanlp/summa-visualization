We define semantic complexity using a new concept of
meaning automata. We measure the semantic complexity of
understanding of prepositional phrases, of an "in depth
understanding system", and of a natural language interface to an on-line
calendar. We argue that it is possible to measure some semantic
complexities of natural language processing systems before building them,
and that systems that exhibit relatively  complex behavior
can be built from semantically simple components.
