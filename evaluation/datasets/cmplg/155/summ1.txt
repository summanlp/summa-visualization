The work reported here is the result of a study done within a larger
project on the ``Semantics of Natural Languages'' viewed from the
field of Artificial Intelligence and Computational Linguistics.  In
this project, we have chosen a corpus of insurance claim
reports.
These texts deal with a relatively circumscribed domain, that of road
traffic, thereby limiting the extra-linguistic knowledge necessary to
understand them.  Moreover, these texts present a number of very
specific characteristics, insofar as they are written in a
quasi-institutional setting which imposes many constraints on their
production.
We first determine what these constraints are in order to then show
how they provide the writer with the means to create as succint a text
as possible, and in a symmetric way, how they provide the reader with
the means to interpret the text and to distinguish between its factual
and argumentative aspects.
