Most spoken language translation systems developed to date rely on a
pipelined architecture, in which the main stages are speech
recognition, linguistic analysis, transfer, generation and speech
synthesis. When making projections of error rates for systems of this
kind, it is natural to assume that the error rates for the individual
components are independent, making the system accuracy the product of
the component accuracies.
The paper reports experiments carried out using the SRI-SICS-Telia
Research Spoken Language Translator and a 1000-utterance sample of
unseen data. The results suggest that the naive performance model
leads to serious overestimates of system error rates, since there are
in fact strong dependencies between the components. Predicting the
system error rate on the independence assumption by simple
multiplication resulted in a 16% proportional overestimate for all
utterances, and a 19% overestimate when only utterances of length 1-10
words were considered.
