A common feature of recent unification-based grammar formalisms is
that they give the user the ability to define his own structures.
However, this possibility is mostly limited and does not include nonmonotonic
operations. In this paper we show how nonmonotonic operations can also be
 user-defined by applying default logic  and generalizing  previous results on nonmonotonic sorts .
