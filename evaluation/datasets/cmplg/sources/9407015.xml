<TITLE>Specifying Intonation from Context for Speech Synthesis</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
<P>
This paper presents a theory and a computational implementation for
generating prosodically appropriate synthetic speech in response to
database queries.  Proper distinctions of contrast and emphasis are
expressed in an intonation contour that is synthesized by rule under
the control of a grammar, a discourse model, and a knowledge base.
The theory is based on Combinatory Categorial Grammar, a formalism
which easily integrates the notions of syntactic constituency,
semantics, prosodic phrasing and information structure.  Results from
our current implementation demonstrate the system's ability to
generate a variety of intonational possibilities for a given sentence
depending on the discourse context.

<DIV ID="1" DEPTH="1" R-NO="1"><HEADER> Introduction </HEADER>
<P>
One source of unnaturalness in the output of many text-to-speech systems
stems from the involvement of algorithmically generated default
intonation contours, applied under minimal control from syntax and
semantics.  The intelligibility of the speech produced by these
systems is a tribute to both the resilience of human language
understanding and the ingenuity of the algorithms' inventors.  It
has often been noted, however, that the results frequently sound
unnatural when taken in context, and may on occasion mislead the
hearer.
It is for this reason that a number of discourse-model-based speech
generation systems have been proposed, in which intonation contour is
determined from context or the model.  Work in this area includes an
early study by Young and Fallside ([<REF/>]), and studies by
Terken ([<REF/>]), Houghton ([<REF/>]), Isard and
Pearson ([<REF/>]), Davis and
Hirschberg ([<REF/>]), Hirschberg ([<REF/>]), and
Zacharski et al.
([<REF/>]), although the representations of information structure
and its relation to syntax employed by these authors are rather different
from those proposed here.
 Consider the exchange shown in <CREF/>, which is an artificial example modeled on the domain of TraumAID, a medical expert system in
the context of which we are investigating spoken language
 output. This particular example is slightly unrealistic in that TraumAID acts purely as a
critiquing device and does not possess such an interactive query
system for its knowledge base; nor is it likely that such a query
system would be of practical use in the trauma surgery.  However,
such examples are useful for present purposes since they force
unambiguously contrastive contexts that motivate intonational focus
and contrastive stress.
 In example <CREF/>, capitals indicate stress and brackets informally indicate the intonational phrasing.  The intonation contour
is indicated more formally using a version of Pierrehumbert's notation
(cf. Pierrehumbert [<REF/>], Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg
 [<REF/>]). In this notation, L+H* and H* are different high pitch accents. LH% (and its relative LH$) and
L (and its relatives LL% and LL$) are rising and low boundaries
respectively.  The difference between members of sets like L, LL% and
LL$ boundaries embodies Pierrehumbert and Beckman's ([<REF/>])
distinction between intermediate phrase boundaries, intonational
 phrase boundaries, and utterance boundaries. We shall skate over the former distinction here, noting only that utterance boundaries are distinguished from the
others by a greater degree of lengthening and pausing.
 The other annotations in <CREF/> indicate that the intonational tunes L+H* LH% (or the related L+H* LH$) and H* L (or the related
H* LL$) convey two distinct kinds of
discourse information.  First, both H* and L+H* pitch accents mark the
word that they occur on (or rather, some element of its
interpretation) for ``focus'', which in
 the context of such simple queries as example <CREF/> usually implies contrast of some kind.  Second, the tunes as a whole mark the
constituent that bears them (or rather, its interpretation) as having
a particular function in the discourse.  We have argued at length
elsewhere that, at least in this same restricted class of dialogues,
the function of the L+H* LH% and L+H* LH$ tunes is to mark the
``theme'' - that
is, ``what the participants have agreed to talk about''.  The
H* L(L%/$) tune marks the ``rheme'' - that is, ``what the speaker has
to say'' about the theme.  This phenomenon is a strong one: the same
intonation contour sounds quite anomalous in the context of a question
that does not establish an appropriate theme, such as ``which
procedure is needed for the persistent  PNEUMOTHORAX?''.  The
advantage for present purposes of Pierrehumbert's system, like other
autosegmental approaches, is that the entire tune
can be defined independently of the particular string that it occurs
with, by interpolation of pitch contour between the pitch-accent(s)
and the boundary for those parts bearing no tonal annotation.  It
will be notationally convenient to speak of the latter as bearing
``null tone''.  (Of course such elements may
bear pitch and even secondary accent, and the
specification of such details of the interpolated contour is by no
means a trivial matter.
However, we do not believe that anything hangs crucially on our use of
this theory of intonation, rather than some other.)

<P>
From the example in the preceding section, it is clear that
intonational units corresponding to theme or rheme
need not always correspond to a traditional syntactic
constituent.  Since many problems in the analysis and synthesis of spoken
language result from this apparent independence of syntactic and
intonational phrase boundaries, we have chosen to base our system
on Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG), a formalism that
generalizes the notion of surface constituency, allowing multiple
derivations and constituent structures for sentences, including ones in
which the subject and verb of a transitive sentence can exist as a
constituent, complete with an interpretation.
CCG (Steedman [<REF/>]) is an extension of
Categorial Grammar (CG).  Elements like verbs are associated with a
syntactic ``category'' which identifies them as functions, and
specifies the type and directionality of their arguments and the type
of their result.  We use a notation in which a rightward-combining
functor over a domain 
</P>
<IMAGE TYPE="FIGURE"/>
<P>
  into a range 
</P>
<IMAGE TYPE="FIGURE"/>
<P>
  is written 
<!-- MATH: $\alpha
/ \beta$ -->
</P>
<IMAGE TYPE="FIGURE"/>
<P>
, while the corresponding leftward-combining functor is written
<!-- MATH: $\alpha\backslash\beta$ -->
</P>
<IMAGE TYPE="FIGURE"/>
<P>
 .  
</P>
<IMAGE TYPE="FIGURE"/>
<P>
  and 
</P>
<IMAGE TYPE="FIGURE"/>
<P>
  may themselves be
function categories.   For example, a transitive verb is a function
from (object) NPs into predicates - that is, into functions from
(subject) NPs into S, written as follows:
<!-- MATH: $(S\backslash NP)/NP$ -->
</P>
<IMAGE TYPE="FIGURE"/>
<P>
We also need the following two rules of functional application, where
X and Y are variables over categories:
 FUNCTIONAL APPLICATION:
</P>
<IMAGE TYPE="FIGURE"/>
<P>
 These rules allow the function category <CREF/>  is a simple example: 
Traumaid   recommends   lavage
--------   ----------   ------
   NP      (S\NP)/NP      NP
           -------------------]
                   S\NP
-----------------------[
           S
The syntactic types in this derivation are simply a reflection of the
corresponding semantic
types, apart from the addition of directional information.  If we
 expand the category <CREF/> to express the semantics of the transitive verb,
the same context-free derivation can be made to build a
compositional interpretation, 
<!-- MATH: $({\em recommend}'\ {\em lavage}')\ {\em
traumaid}'$ -->
</P>
<IMAGE TYPE="FIGURE"/>
<P>
.  One way of writing such an interpreted category that is
particularly convenient for translating into unification-based
programming languages like Prolog is the following:
<!-- MATH: $\it (S:recommend'~x~y\backslash NP:y)/NP:x$ -->
</P>
<IMAGE TYPE="FIGURE"/>
<P>
 In <CREF/>, syntactic types are paired with a semantic interpretation via the colon operator, and the category is that of a
function from NPs (with interpretation 
</P>
<IMAGE TYPE="FIGURE"/>
<P>
 ) to functions
from NPs (with interpretation 
</P>
<IMAGE TYPE="FIGURE"/>
<P>
 ) to Ss (with
interpretation 
<!-- MATH: $\it recommend'~x~y$ -->
</P>
<IMAGE TYPE="FIGURE"/>
<P>
 ).   Constants in
interpretations bear primes, variables do not, and there is a
convention of left-associativity, so that 
<!-- MATH: $recommend'~x~y$ -->
recommend' x y is
equivalent to 
<!-- MATH: $(recommend'~x)~y$ -->
(recommend' x) y.
CCG extends this strictly context-free categorial base in two respects.  First,
all arguments, such as NPs, bear only type-raised categories, such as
<!-- MATH: $S/(S\backslash NP)$ -->
</P>
<IMAGE TYPE="FIGURE"/>
<P>
 .  That is to say that the category of an NP,
rather than being that of a simple argument, is that of a function
over functions-over-such-arguments, namely verbs and the like.
Similarly, all functions into such categories, such as
determiners, are functions into the raised categories, such as
<!-- MATH: $(S / (S \backslash NP)) /N$ -->
</P>
<IMAGE TYPE="FIGURE"/>
<P>
 .  For example, subject NPs bear the
following category in the full notation:
traumaid := 
<!-- MATH: $\it S:s/(S:s\backslash NP:traumaid')$ -->
</P>
<IMAGE TYPE="FIGURE"/>
<P>
The derivation of the same simple transitive sentence using
 type-raised categories is illustrated in example <CREF/>  in the abbreviated notation. 
Traumaid  recommends        lavage
--------  ----------  ------------------
S/(S\NP)  (S\NP)/NP   (S\NP)\((S\NP)/NP)
          ------------------------------[
                     S\NP
-------------------------]
           S
Second, the combinatory rules are extended to include functional
composition, as well as application:
 FORWARD COMPOSITION (]B):
</P>
<IMAGE TYPE="FIGURE"/>
<P>
This rule allows a second syntactic derivation for the above sentence, as
 shown in example <CREF/>. 
Traumaid  recommends   lavage
--------  ----------  --------
S/(S\NP)  (S\NP)/NP   S\(S/NP)
--------------------]B
        S/NP
        ----------------------[
                 S
The original reason for making these moves was to capture the fact
that fragments like Traumaid recommends, which in traditional
terms are not regarded as syntactic constituents, can nevertheless
 take part in coordinate constructions, like <CREF/>, and form the residue of relative clause formation, as in
 <CREF/>. 
<ITEMIZE>
<ITEM>[a.] You propose, and Traumaid recommends, lavage.
</ITEM>
<ITEM>[b.] The treatment that Traumaid recommends
</ITEM>
</ITEMIZE>
The full extent of this theory (which covers unbounded rightward and
leftward ``movement'', and a number of other types of supposedly
``non-constituent'' coordination), together with the general class of
rules from which the composition rule is drawn, and the problem of
processing in the face of such associative rules, is discussed in the
earlier papers, and need not concern us here.  The point for present
purposes is that the partition of the sentence into the object and a
non-standard constituent (
<!-- MATH: $\it S:recommend'~x~traumaid'/NP:x$ -->
</P>
<IMAGE TYPE="FIGURE"/>
<P>
 ) makes
this theory structurally and semantically perfectly suited to the
demands of intonation, as exhibited in exchanges like the
 following: 
<ITEMIZE>
<ITEM>[Q:] I know that the surgeon recommends a left thoracotomy,
but what does Traumaid recommend?
</ITEM>
<ITEM>[A:] 
( T RAUMAID recommends) ( LA VAGE.)
L+H* 		 LH% 		  H* LL$ 
</ITEM>
</ITEMIZE>
We can therefore directly incorporate intonational constituency in
syntax, as follows (cf. Steedman [<REF/>]).  First,
we assign to each constituent an autonomous prosodic category,
expressing its potential for combination with other prosodic
categories.  Then we lock these two structural systems together via
the following principle, which says that syntactic and prosodic
constituency must be isomorphic:
 PROSODIC CONSTITUENT CONDITION:
Combination of two syntactic categories via a syntactic combinatory
rule is only allowed if their prosodic categories can also combine
via a prosodic combinatory rule.
One way to accomplish this is to give pitch accents the category of
functions from boundaries to intonational/intermediate phrases.
As in CCG, categories consist of a (prosodic) structural type, and an
(information structural) interpretation, associated via a colon.  The pitch
 accents have the following functional types: 
We further assume, following Bird ([<REF/>]),
that the presence of a pitch accent causes some element(s) in the
translation of the category to be marked as focused, a matter which
we will for simplicity assume to occur at the level of the lexicon.  For
example, when recommends bears a pitch accent, its category will
be written as follows:
<!-- MATH: $(S:*recommend'~x~y\backslash NP:y)/NP:x$ -->
</P>
<IMAGE TYPE="FIGURE"/>
<P>
We depart from earlier versions of this theory in assuming that
boundaries are not simply arguments of such functions, but are
 rather akin to type-raised arguments, as follows: 
These categories closely correspond to Pierrehumbert's distinction
between  various levels of phonological phrases.  For example, the
boundary L maps an
H* pitch accent into an intermediate phrase rheme, p:rheme.
The LH% boundary maps an L+H* pitch accent onto a full intonation
phrase, which it is convenient for present purposes to write as
p:theme.   (In a fuller notation we would make the distinction
between intermediate and intonational phrases explicit, but for
present purposes it is irrelevant).  The LH$ boundary
maps the same L+H* pitch accent
into an utterance-level thematic phrase, written u:theme.
The categories that result from the combination of a pitch
accent and a boundary may or may not
constitute entire prosodic phrases, since there may be
prenuclear material bearing null tone.  There may also be
material bearing null tone separating the
pitch accent(s) from the boundary.  (Both possibilities are
 illustrated in <CREF/>).   We therefore assign the following category to the null tone, which can thereby
apply to the right to any non-functional category of the form
X:Y, and compose to the right with any function into such a
category, including another null tone, to yield the same category:
It is this omnivorous category that allows intonational tunes to be
spread over arbitrarily large constituents, since it allows the pitch
accent's desire for a boundary to propagate via composition into the
null tone category, as in the earlier papers.
In order to allow the derivation to proceed above the level of
complete prosodic phrases identifying themes and rhemes, we need the two
 unary category-changing rules shown in <CREF/> to change the phonological category of complete themes  and rhemes. 
These rules change the prosodic category either to
utterance, or to an endocentric function over that category.
These types capture the fact that the
LL$ and LH$ boundaries can only occur at the end of a sentence, thereby
correcting an overgeneration in some early versions of this theory
noted by Bird ([<REF/>]).  The fact that
utterance is an atom rather than a
term of the form X:Y is important, since it means that it can
unify only with another utterance.   This is vital to the preservation of the
 intonation structure. 
The application of the above two rules to a complete intonational
phrase should be thought of as precipitating a side-effect whereby a
copy of the category 
</P>
<IMAGE TYPE="FIGURE"/>
<P>
  is associated with the clause as its
theme or rheme.  (We gloss over details of how
this is done, as well as a number of further
complications arising in sentences with more than one rheme).
In Steedman ([<REF/>]), a related set of rules of which
the present ones form a subset are shown to be well-behaved with a
 wide range of examples.  Example <CREF/>. 
      Traumaid                  recommends             lavage

           S:recommend' x *traumaid'/NP:x            NP:*lavage'
                 utterance/utterance                  utterance
           -------------------------SYN-------------------------]
           -------------------------PHON------------------------]
                      S: recommend' *lavage' *traumaid'

<ITEM>[Theme:] 
<!-- MATH: $S:recommend'~z~{*traumaid'}/NP:z$ -->
S:recommend' z *traumaid'/NP:z
</ITEM>
<ITEM>[Rheme:] 
<!-- MATH: $NP:*lavage$ -->
NP:*lavage
</ITEM>
</ITEMIZE>
Note that it is the identification of the theme and rheme at
the stage before the final reduction
that determines the information structure for the response, for it is
at this point that
discourse elements like the theme of the answer can be defined, and can be
used in semantically-driven synthesis of intonation contour directly
from the grammar.
Of course, such effusively informative intonation contours are
comparatively rare in normal dialogues.  A more usual response to the
 question ``What does Traumaid recommend?'' in <CREF/> would put low pitch - that is, the null tone in Pierrehumbert's terms - on
everything except the focus of the rheme, lavage, as in
 <CREF/>. 
Traumaid recommends  LA VAGE.
H* LL$ 
Such an utterance is of course ambiguous as to whether the theme is
traumaid or what traumaid recommends.  The earlier papers show
that such ``unmarked'' themes, which include no primary pitch accent because
they are entirely background, can be captured by a ``Null Theme
Promotion Rule'', as follows:
</P>
<IMAGE TYPE="FIGURE"/>
<P>
This rule says that any sequence bearing the null tone can be
regarded as an ``unmarked'' intermediate phrase theme.
</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="3" DEPTH="1" R-NO="3"><HEADER>Modeling Contrast</HEADER>
<P>
The preceding remarks about the ambiguity of unmarked themes should
make it clear that in general the information structure of the
response to a query cannot be identified on the basis of the question
alone, but requires information from the discourse model as well, to
 which we now turn. 
This remark applies even more strongly to the assignment of focus and
the corresponding pitch accents in the generation of the response, as
Davis and Hirschberg ([<REF/>]), and Hirschberg
([<REF/>]), among others, have pointed out.  That is, while it
might appear as though pitch-accents could be assigned on some basis
such as the mention or non-mention of the relevant words in the theme
of the query, such an expedient will often break down.  Consider the
following example, which might be produced by such a strategem, since
the words ``left'' and ``thoracotomy'' do not occur in the theme Which
 incision: Q:
Which incision does  TRAUMAID prefer?
A:
( T RAUMAID prefers) (a  L EFTthora C OTomy.)
L+H* 		 LH% 		 H* 		 H* LL$ 
In some contexts, including the null context, this intonation contour
will indeed be appropriate.  However, in any context where thoracotomy
procedures are already established as the set of procedures in question,
the pitch accent on thoracotomy in
the response will be inappropriate and perhaps even misleading.
 For example, in <CREF/> below, the noun thoracotomy must remain unstressed while the adjective left must be accented in
the response, despite having been explicitly mentioned in the text of
 the question. Here the question itself establishes a contextual set.  The fact that
the entity that is referenced in the response must be contrasted with
other alternatives in this set on the relevant property requires the
assignment of a pitch accent to the corresponding word.
Q:
Does Traumaid prefer a  LEFT thoracotomy or a 
RIGHT thoracotomy?
A:
(Traumaid prefers) (a  LEFT thoracotomy.)The mere fact that alternatives are contrasted on a given
property is not enough however to mandate the inclusion of a pitch accent on
the corresponding linguistic material.   The property in question
must restrict contrastively at the relevant point in the semantic
evaluation, before a pitch accent is forced.
Thus, in a situation in which the choices include a left thoracotomy,
a right thoracotomy, a left thoracostomy and a right thoracostomy,
 the response to question <CREF/>, in which the adjective is unstressed, is perfectly
 appropriate: Q:
Does Traumaid prefer a  LEFT thora COTomy or a
 RIGHT thora COSTomy?
A:
(Traumaid prefers) (a left thora COTomy).This example suggests that the set that is being considered by the
time the adjective is semantically evaluated is no longer the entire
set including the left and right thoracotomy and thoracostomy
procedures.  In fact, it is not even the set containing only the left
thoracotomy and right thoracostomy procedures, but rather the set
containing only the left thoracotomy procedure, which by definition
does not stand in contrast to any other thoracotomy procedure by
virtue of the property of being performed on the left side.  This set
arises because the noun thoracotomy restricts over the set including
the left thoracotomy and the right thoracostomy procedures.
To see this, consider the next exchange, uttered in the same
situation.
Q:
Does Traumaid prefer a  LEFT thora COTomy, a 
RIGHT thora COTomy or a  LEFT thora COSTomy?
A:
(Traumaid prefers) (a  LEFT thora COTomy).Here the set established by the question is restricted by the noun in
the rheme of the answer to be a set of two thoracotomy procedures
(both left and right).  Since they are distinguished by the property
left, the corresponding linguistic material must be accented.
The algorithm for determining which items are to be stressed for
 reasons of contrast works as follows. For a given object x, we associate a set of properties which are essential for
constructing an expression that uniquely refers to x, as well as a
set of objects (and their referring properties) which might be
considered alternatives to x with respect to the database
under consideration.  The set of alternatives is restricted by
properties or objects explicitly mentioned in the theme of the
question.  Then for each property of x in turn, we restrict the set
of alternatives to include only those objects having the given
property.  If imposing this restriction decreases the size of the set
of alternatives, then the given property serves to distinguish xfrom its alternatives, suggesting that the corresponding linguistic
material should be stressed.
Besides determining the location of primary sentence stress,
contrastive properties may also necessitate adopting non-standard
lexical stress patterns.  For example, in the following
question/answer pair, the normal lexical stress on thor switches
to pneu in pneumothorax because pneumothorax stands
in contrast to hemothorax.
Q:
I know which procedure is recommended for the simple
hemothorax.
But which condition is a left  THORACOSTOMY
recommended for?
A:
A left  THORACOSTOMY is recommended for the
simple  PNEUmothorax.In the current implementation, such lexical stress shift is handled by
identifying the lexical contrast properties in the alternative set
representations and supplying separate pronunciations in the lexicon.
However, when such properties are determined to stand in contrast to one
another, the alternate pronunciation could in principle be generated by
employing the methods described above within the lexicon.

<P>
The present paper is an attempt to apply the theories outlined in the
preceding sections to the task of specifying contextually
appropriate intonation for natural language responses to database
 queries.  The architecture of the system (shown in Figure <CREF/>) identifies the key modules of the system, their relationships to the
database and the underlying grammar, and the dependencies among their
inputs and outputs.
The process begins with a fully segmented and prosodically annotated
representation of a spoken query, as shown in example
 <CREF/>.  We employ a simple bottom-up shift-reduce parser, making direct use of the combinatory
prosody theory described above, to identify the semantics of the
question.  The inclusion of prosodic categories in the grammar allows
the parser to identify the information structure within the question
 as well, marking ``focused'' items with *, as shown in <CREF/>. For the moment, unmarked themes are handled by taking the longest
unmarked constituent permitted by the syntax.

The content generation module, which has the task of determining the
semantics and information structure of the response, relies on several
simplifying assumptions.  Foremost among these is the notion that the
rheme of the question is the sole determinant of the theme of the
response, including the specification of focus (although the type of
pitch accent that eventually marks the focus will be different in the
response).  The overall semantic structure of the response can be
determined by instantiating the variable in the lambda expression
corresponding to the wh-question with a simple Prolog query.
Given the syntactic and focus-marked semantic representation for the
response, along with the syntactic and focus-marked semantic
representation for the theme of the response, a representation for the
rheme of the response can be worked out from the CCG rules.  The
assignment of focus for the rheme of the response (i.e.  the
instantiated variable) must be worked out from scratch, on the basis
of the alternative sets in the database, as described in section 3.
 For the question given in <CREF/>, the content generator produces the following:
Proposition:
<!-- MATH: $s:address(*urinalysis, *hematuria)$ -->
s:address(*urinalysis, *hematuria)
Theme:
<!-- MATH: $s:address(*urinalysis, x)/np:x$ -->
s:address(*urinalysis, x)/np:x
Rheme:
<!-- MATH: $np:*hematuria$ -->
np:*hematuria
From the output of the content generator, the CCG generation
module produces a string of words and Pierrehumbert-style markings
 representing the response, as shown in <CREF/>. 
urinalysis@lhstar addresses@lh hematuria@hstarllb
The final aspect of generation involves translating such a string into
a form usable by a suitable speech synthesizer.  The current
implementation uses the Bell Laboratories TTS system (Liberman and
Buchsbaum [<REF/>]) as a post-processor to synthesize the speech
wave itself.

<DIV ID="5" DEPTH="1" R-NO="5"><HEADER>Results</HEADER>
<P>
The system described above produces quite sharp and natural-sounding
distinctions of intonation contour in minimal pairs of queries like
 those in examples <CREF/>, which should be read as concerning a single patient with multiple wounds.  These examples
illustrate the system's capability for producing appropriately
different intonation contours for a single string of words under the
control of discourse context. If the responses in these examples are
interchanged, the results sound distinctly unnatural in the given
 contexts. 
 Examples <CREF/> illustrate the necessity of the theme/rheme distinction.  Although the pitch accent locations in
the responses in these examples are identical, occurring on thoracostomy and simple, the alternation in the
theme and rheme tunes is necessary to convey the intended proposition
in the given contexts.
 Examples <CREF/> show that the system makes appropriate distinctions in focus placement
within themes and rhemes based on context.  Although the responses in these two
sentences possess the same intonational tunes, the pitch accent
location is crucial for conveying the appropriate contrastive
properties.
 Examples <CREF/> manifest the eight basic combinatorial possibilities for pitch accent placement and tune
selection produced by our program for the given sentence.
The inclusion of contrastive lexical stress shift increases the
number of intonational possibilities even more, as exemplified in
 <CREF/>.

<P>
The results show that is possible to generate synthesized spoken
responses with contextually appropriate intonational contours in a
database query task.  Many important problems remain, both because of
the limited range of discourse-types and intonational tunes considered
here, and because of the extreme oversimplification of the discourse
model (particularly with respect to the ontology, or variety of types
of discourse entities).  Nevertheless, the system presented here has a
number of properties that we believe augur well for its extension to
richer varieties of discourse, including the types of monologues and
commentaries that are more appropriate for the actual TraumAID domain.
Foremost among these is the fact that the system and the underlying
theory are entirely modular.  That is, any of its components can be
replaced without affecting any other component because each is
entirely independent of the particular grammar defined by the lexicon
and the particular knowledge base that the discourse concerns.  It is
only because CCG allows us to unify the structures implicated
in syntax and semantics on the one hand, and intonation and discourse
information on the other, that this modular structure can be so simply
attained.

  The examples used throughout the paper are based on a
the domain of TraumAID, which is currently under development at the
University of Pennsylvania (Webber et al. [<REF/>]).  The
lay reader may find it useful to know that a thoracostomy is the
insertion of a tube into the chest, and pneumothorax refers to
the presence of air or gas in the pleural cavity.
  A brief summary of Pierrehumbert's notation
can be found in Steedman ([<REF/>]).
  Since utterance
boundaries always coincide with an intonational phrase boundary, this
distinction is often left implicit in the literature, both being
written with % boundaries.  For purposes of synthesis, however, the
distinction is important.
  It may be helpful for the
reader to know that lavage refers to the therapeutic cleansing
of an organ.
  It is important to
realize that the semantics of the type raised categories and of the
application rules ensures that this derivation yields an S with the
 same interpretation as the earlier derivation <CREF/>, namely 
<!-- MATH: $\it recommend'~lavage'~traumaid'$ -->

 .  At first glance, it looks as
though type-raising will expand the lexicon alarmingly.  One way round
this problem is discussed in
Steedman ([<REF/>]).
  As before, it is important to realize that the semantics of the
categories and of the new rule of functional composition guarantee
that the S
yielded in this derivation bears exactly the same interpretation as
 the original purely applicative derivation <CREF/>. 
  A similar argument in a related categorial
framework is made by Moortgat ([<REF/>]).
  Here we are ignoring the possibility of multiple pitch accents in the
same prosodic phrase, but cf. Steedman ([<REF/>]).
  Note
again that $ boundaries are often conflated with % intonational
phrase boundaries in the literature.  These categories, which in some
sense imply that boundaries are phonological heads, constitute a
modification to previous versions of the present theory that brings it
more closely into line with the proposals in Pierrehumbert and
Hirschberg ([<REF/>]).  The idea that boundaries are functors
has been independently proposed by Kirkeby-Garstad and Polgardi
(p.c.).
  These rules represent another minor
departure from the earlier papers.
  The category has the effect of preventing further composition into the
null tone achieved in the earlier papers by a restriction on forward
prosodic composition.
  Note that since the raised
object category is not crucial, it has been replaced by NP for ease of reading
comprehension.  Also note the focus-marking effect of the pitch accents.
  See Prevost and Steedman ([<REF/>])
for an investigation of how much one can get away with on the basis of
the question alone.
  It may be helpful to point out that a thoracotomy is a surgical incision of the chest wall, and a thoracostomy is the insertion of a tube into the chest.
  In using these examples to motivate the
treatment of contrast in the system, we go beyond the class of
discourses that are actually handled by the system as currently
implemented.  We are in fact glossing over a number of subtle problems
concerning the theme-rheme structures that are involved, and the
precise reflection of these information structures in intonation.
  That is not to claim that the adjective cannot carry a pitch
accent, of course.
  We omit a more detailed
description of the algorithm and its associated data structures for
the sake of brevity.  A more detailed account and numerous examples
are given in Prevost and Steedman ([<REF/>]).
  We stress that we do not start
with a speech wave, but a representation that one might obtain from a
hypothetical system that translates such a wave into strings of words
with Pierrehumbert-style intonation markings.
  Full
descriptions of the CCG generation algorithm are given in
Prevost and Steedman ([<REF/>]).
  The first line of each query is for reader
assistance only, and is not processed by the system described here.
