This paper defines a language 
for specifying LFG grammars.
This enables constraints on LFG's composite ontology (c-structures
synchronised with f-structures) to be stated directly; no appeal to
the LFG construction algorithm is needed.  We use 
to specify
schemata annotated rules and the LFG uniqueness, completeness and
coherence principles.  Broader issues raised by this work
are noted and discussed.
