Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems generate texts in English
(or other human
languages, such as French) from computer-accessible data.  NLG systems are
(currently) most often used to help human authors write routine documents,
 including business letters  and  weather reports .  They also have been used as interactive explanation tools which communicate information in
an understandable way to non-expert users, especially in software
 engineering (eg, ) and medical (eg, ) contexts.
From a technical perspective, almost all applied NLG systems perform the
 following three tasks : 
Content Determination and Text Planning:
Decide what information should be communicated to the user (content
determination), and how this information should be rhetorically structured
(text planning).  These tasks are usually done simultaneously.
Sentence Planning:
Decide how the information will be split among individual sentences and
paragraphs, and what cohesion devices
(eg, pronouns, discourse markers)
should be added to make the text flow smoothly.
Realization:
Generate the individual sentences in a grammatically correct manner.
In the rest of this paper, I shall briefly discuss different ways of
performing each of these tasks.
