 In  we studied a new type of DCGs, Datalog grammars, which are inspired on database theory. Their efficiency
was shown to be better than that of their DCG counterparts under
(terminating) OLDT-resolution.  In this article we motivate a variant of
 Datalog grammars
which allows us a meta-grammatical treatment of coordination. This treatment
improves in some respects over previous work on coordination in logic
grammars, although more research is needed for testing it in other respects.
