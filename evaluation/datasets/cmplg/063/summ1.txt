This paper concerns how to generate and understand
discourse anaphoric noun phrases.
I present the results of an
analysis of all discourse anaphoric noun phrases (N=1,233) in a corpus of ten
narrative monologues, where the choice between a definite
pronoun or phrasal NP conforms largely to
Gricean constraints on informativeness.  I discuss Dale 
Reiter's [] recent model and show how it can be
augmented for understanding as well as generating the range of data
presented here.  I argue that integrating
 centering   with this model can be applied uniformly to discourse anaphoric pronouns and phrasal
NPs.  I conclude with a hypothesis for
addressing the interaction between local and
global discourse processing.
