We present an unsupervised learning algorithm that
acquires a natural-language lexicon from raw speech.  The algorithm is
based on the optimal encoding of symbol sequences in an MDL framework,
and uses a hierarchical representation of language that overcomes many
of the problems that have stymied previous grammar-induction
procedures.  The forward mapping from symbol sequences to the speech
stream is modeled using features based on articulatory gestures.  We
present results on the acquisition of lexicons and language models from
raw speech, text, and phonetic transcripts, and demonstrate that our
algorithm compares very favorably to other reported results with
respect to segmentation performance and statistical efficiency.
