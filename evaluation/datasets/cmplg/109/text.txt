The second and third heuristic methods show high accuracy in
finding the referents of dousha with ga and ha.
This means that partial semantic parsing (in which key semantic
information such as company name, human name, and title is marked) is
sufficient for reference resolution of important referential
expressions such as dousha in Japanese.  Moreover, since
the two modified methods are simple, they will be easily implemented by
computationally inexpensive finite-state pattern matchers (Hobbs et al.
1992; Cowie et al. 1993).  Therefore, they will be suitable for large
scale text processing (Jacobs 1992; Chinchor et al. 1993).
One important point to realize is that the second and third
methods, although they are simple to implement,
achieve something that is rather complicated and may be
computationally expensive otherwise.  For example, in order to find
the correct referent of
a given dousha, you may have to skip one entire paragraph and
find the referent two paragraphs before, or you may have to choose
the right company name from several possible company names which
appear before the given dousha.  The modified methods
do this correctly most of the time without worrying about
constructing sometimes complicated syntactic structures of the
sentences in the search window for the possible referent.
Another important point is that the modified methods make good use
of post-nominal particles, especially ha and ga.
For example, if the referent is located two sentences or
more before, then the referent (the company name) comes with ha
almost all the time (35 out of 38 such cases for both dousha).
It seems that if the referent of the dousha in consideration is
more than a certain distance before, two sentences in this case,
then the referent is marked with ha most of the time.
Kitani also uses this ha or ga marked company names
as key information in his reference resolution algorithm for
dousha (Kitani 1994).

The locations and contexts of the referents of dousha in
Japanese Joint-Venture articles are determined by hand.  Three
heuristic methods are proposed and tested.  The methods which use
semantic information in the text and its patterns show high accuracy
in finding the referents (96% for dousha with ga and
96% for dousha with ha for the unseen test data).
The high success rates suggest that
a semantic pattern-matching approach is not only a valid method but
also an efficient method for reference resolution in the newspaper article
domains.  Since the Japanese language is highly case-inflected, case
(particle)
information is used effectively in these methods for reference
resolution.  How much one can do with semantic pattern matching for
reference resolution of similar expressions such as ``the company'' or
``the Japanese company'' in English newspaper articles is a
topic for future research.
