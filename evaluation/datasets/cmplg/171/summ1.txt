This paper presents a pruning technique which can be used to reduce
the number of paths searched in rule-based bag generators of the type
 proposed by  and .  Pruning the search space in these generators is important given the computational
cost of bag generation. The technique relies on a connectivity
constraint between the semantic indices associated with each lexical
sign in a bag. Testing the algorithm on a range of sentences shows
reductions in the generation time and the number of edges constructed.
