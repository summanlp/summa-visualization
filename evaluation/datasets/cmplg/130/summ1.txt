A novel  approach to   HPSG based natural language processing  is
described  that  uses an  off-line compiler to  automatically  prime a
declarative grammar  for generation or parsing, and inputs  the primed
grammar to an advanced Earley-style processor.  This way we provide an
elegant  solution to  the  problems  with  empty  heads and  efficient
bidirectional processing which is illustrated for the special  case of
  HPSG generation.  Extensive  testing  with  a large   HPSG
grammar  revealed  some  important  constraints  on  the  form  of the
grammar.
