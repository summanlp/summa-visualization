The relationship between Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG) functional structures (f-structures) for sentences and their semantic
interpretations can be expressed directly in a fragment of linear
logic in a way that explains correctly the constrained interactions
between quantifier scope ambiguity and bound anaphora.
The use of a deductive framework to account for the compositional
properties of quantifying expressions in natural language obviates the
need for additional mechanisms, such as Cooper storage, to represent
the different scopes that a quantifier might take.  Instead, the
semantic contribution of a quantifier is recorded as an ordinary
logical formula, one whose use in a proof will establish the scope of
the quantifier.  The properties of linear logic ensure that each
quantifier is scoped exactly once.
Our analysis of quantifier scope can be seen as a recasting of
 Pereira's analysis , which was expressed in higher-order intuitionistic logic.  But our use of LFG and linear
logic provides a much more direct and computationally more
flexible interpretation mechanism for at least the same range of
phenomena.  We have developed a preliminary Prolog implementation
of the linear deductions described in this work.
