In conversation, a person sometimes has to refer to an object
that is not previously known to the other participant.  We present a
plan-based model of how agents collaborate on reference of this sort.
In making a reference, an agent uses the most salient attributes of the
referent.  In understanding a reference, an agent determines his
confidence in its adequacy as a means of identifying the referent.  To
collaborate, the agents use judgment, suggestion, and elaboration moves
to refashion an inadequate referring expression.
