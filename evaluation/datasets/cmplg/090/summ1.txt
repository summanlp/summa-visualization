The paper describes a parser for Categorial Grammar which provides
  fully word by word incremental interpretation. The parser does not
  require fragments of sentences to form constituents, and thereby
  avoids problems of spurious ambiguity. The paper includes a brief
  discussion of the relationship between basic Categorial Grammar and
  other formalisms such as HPSG, Dependency Grammar and the Lambek
  Calculus. It also includes a discussion of some of the issues which
  arise when parsing lexicalised grammars, and the possibilities for
  using statistical techniques for tuning to particular languages.
