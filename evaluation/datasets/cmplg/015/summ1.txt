Analyzing compound nouns is one of the crucial issues for natural
language processing systems, in particular for those systems that aim
at a wide coverage of domains.  In this paper, we propose a method to
analyze structures of Japanese compound nouns by using both word
collocations statistics and a thesaurus. An experiment is conducted
with 160,000 word collocations to analyze compound nouns of with an
average length of 4.9 characters. The accuracy of this method is about
80%.
