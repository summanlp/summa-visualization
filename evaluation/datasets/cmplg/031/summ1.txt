This paper presents a theory and a computational implementation for
generating prosodically appropriate synthetic speech in response to
database queries.  Proper distinctions of contrast and emphasis are
expressed in an intonation contour that is synthesized by rule under
the control of a grammar, a discourse model, and a knowledge base.
The theory is based on Combinatory Categorial Grammar, a formalism
which easily integrates the notions of syntactic constituency,
semantics, prosodic phrasing and information structure.  Results from
our current implementation demonstrate the system's ability to
generate a variety of intonational possibilities for a given sentence
depending on the discourse context.
