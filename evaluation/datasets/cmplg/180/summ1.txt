We present a methodology to extract Selectional Restrictions at a
variable level of abstraction from phrasally analyzed corpora. The
method relays in the use of a wide-coverage noun taxonomy and a
statistical measure of the co-occurrence of linguistic items. Some
experimental results about the performance of the method are
provided.
