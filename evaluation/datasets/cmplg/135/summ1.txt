Both statistical and rule-based approaches to part-of-speech (POS)
disambiguation have their own advantages and limitations. Especially for
Korean, the narrow windows provided by hidden markov model (HMM) cannot cover
the necessary lexical and long-distance dependencies for POS disambiguation.
On the other hand, the
rule-based approaches are not accurate and flexible to new tag-sets and
languages. In this regard, the statistical/rule-based hybrid method
that can take
advantages of both approaches is called for the robust and flexible POS
disambiguation. We present one of such method, that is, a two-phase
learning architecture for the hybrid statistical/rule-based
POS disambiguation, especially for Korean.
In this method, the statistical learning of morphological tagging is
error-corrected by
the rule-based learning of Brill [1992] style tagger. We also design the
hierarchical and flexible Korean tag-set to cope with the multiple
tagging applications, each of which requires different tag-set.
Our experiments show
that the two-phase learning method can overcome the undesirable features
of solely HMM-based or solely rule-based tagging, especially for
morphologically
complex Korean.
