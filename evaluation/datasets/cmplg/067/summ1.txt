In this paper we provide a probabilistic interpretation for typed
  feature structures very similar to those used by Pollard and Sag.
  We begin with a version of the interpretation which lacks a
  treatment of re-entrant feature structures, then provide an extended
  interpretation which allows them.  We sketch algorithms allowing the
  numerical parameters of our probabilistic interpretations of HPSG to
  be estimated  from corpora.
