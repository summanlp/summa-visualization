A model for the full treatment of Spanish inflection for verbs, nouns and
adjectives is presented. This model is based on feature unification and it
relies upon a lexicon of allomorphs both for stems and morphemes.  Word
forms are built by the concatenation of allomorphs by means of special
contextual features. We make use of standard Definite Clause Grammars (DCG)
included in most Prolog implementations, instead of the typical
finite-state approach. This allows us to take advantage of the
declarativity and bidirectionality of Logic Programming for NLP.
The most salient feature of this approach is simplicity: A really
straightforward rule and lexical components. We have developed a very simple
model for complex phenomena.
Declarativity, bidirectionality, consistency and completeness of the model
are discussed: all and only correct word forms are analysed or generated,
even alternative ones and gaps in paradigms are preserved.  A Prolog
implementation has been developed for both analysis and generation of
Spanish word forms.  It consists of only six DCG rules, because our lexicalist approach -i.e. most information is in the
dictionary. Although it is quite efficient, the current implementation
could be improved for analysis by using the non logical features of Prolog,
especially in word segmentation and dictionary access.
