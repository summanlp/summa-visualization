In this paper I report on an investigation into the problem of assigning
tones to pitch contours.  The proposed model is intended to serve as a
tool for phonologists working on instrumentally obtained pitch
data from tone languages.  Motivation and exemplification for the model
is provided by data taken from my fieldwork on Bamileke Dschang (Cameroon).
Following recent work by Liberman and others, I provide a parametrised
F0 prediction function 
which generates F0 values from a
tone sequence, and I explore the asymptotic behaviour of downstep.
Next, I observe that transcribing a sequence X of pitch
(i.e. F0) values
amounts to finding a tone sequence T such that 

.
This is a combinatorial optimisation problem, for which two
non-deterministic search techniques are provided:
a genetic algorithm and a simulated annealing algorithm.
Finally, two implementations--one for each technique--are described
and then compared using both
artificial and real data for sequences of up to 20 tones.
These programs can be adapted to other tone languages by adjusting
the F0 prediction function.
