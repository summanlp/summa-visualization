Many different tagsets are used in existing corpora;
  these tagsets vary according to the objectives of specific projects
  (which may be as far apart as robust parsing vs.  spelling
  correction). In many situations, however, one would like to have
  uniform access to the linguistic information encoded in corpus
  annotations without having to know the classification schemes in
  detail. This paper describes a tool which maps unstructured
  morphosyntactic tags to a constraint-based, typed, configurable
  specification language, a ``standard tagset''.  The mapping relies
  on a manually written set of mapping rules, which is automatically
  checked for consistency.  In certain cases, unsharp mappings are
  unavoidable, and noise, i.e.  groups of word forms not conforming
  to the specification, will appear in the output of the mapping.  The
  system automatically detects such noise and informs the user about it.
 The tool has been tested with rules for the UPenn tagset     and the SUSANNE tagset , in the framework of the    EAGLES validation   phase for standardised tagsets for European languages.
