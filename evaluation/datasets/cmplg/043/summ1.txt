We earlier described two taggers for French, a statistical one and a
constraint-based one.  The two taggers have the same tokeniser and
morphological analyser.  In this paper, we describe aspects of this
work concerned with the definition of the tagset, the building of the
lexicon, derived from an existing two-level morphological analyser,
and the definition of a lexical transducer for guessing unknown words.
