Vijay-Shanker and Weir  show that Linear Indexed
Grammars (lig) can be processed in polynomial time by exploiting
constraints which make possible the extensive use of
structure-sharing. This paper describes a formalism that is more
powerful than lig, but which can also be processed in polynomial time
using similar techniques. The formalism, which we refer to as Partially
Linear PATR (plpatr) manipulates feature structures rather than
stacks.
