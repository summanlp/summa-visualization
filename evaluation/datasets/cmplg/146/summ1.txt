We describe a computational framework for a grammar architecture
in which different linguistic domains such as morphology, syntax,
and semantics are treated not as separate components but
compositional domains. Word and phrase formation are modeled as
uniform processes contributing to the derivation of the semantic form.
The morpheme, as well as the lexeme, has lexical representation
in the form of semantic content, tactical constraints, and phonological
realization. The model is based on Combinatory Categorial Grammars.
