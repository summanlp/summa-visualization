This is an interim report discussing possible guidelines for the assessment and
evaluation of projects developing speech and language systems. 
After a discussion of terminology, the report focusses on combining
user-centred and technology-centred assessment, and on how meaningful
comparisons can be made of a variety of systems performing different
tasks for different domains.  The report outlines the kind of
infra-structure that might be required to support comparative
assessment and evaluation of heterogenous projects, and also the
results of a questionnaire concerning different approaches to
evaluation.
