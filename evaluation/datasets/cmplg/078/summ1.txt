The paper presents a prototype lexicalist Machine Translation system (based on
 the so-called `Shake-and-Bake' approach of ) consisting of an analysis component, a dynamic bilingual lexicon, and a generation component,
and shows how it is applied to a range of MT problems. Multi-Lexeme
translations are handled through bi-lexical rules which map bilingual lexical
signs into new bilingual lexical signs. It is argued that much translation can
be handled by equating translationally equivalent lists of lexical signs,
either directly in the bilingual lexicon, or by deriving them through
bi-lexical rules.  Lexical semantic information organized as Qualia structures
   (   ( is used as a mechanism for restricting the domain of the rules.
