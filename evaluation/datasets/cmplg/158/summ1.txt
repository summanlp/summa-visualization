An account of utterance interpretation in discourse needs to face the
issue of how the discourse context controls the space of interacting
preferences. Assuming a discourse processing architecture that
distinguishes the grammar and pragmatics subsystems in terms of
monotonic and nonmonotonic inferences, I will discuss how
independently motivated default preferences interact in the
interpretation of intersentential pronominal anaphora.
In the framework of a general discourse processing model that
integrates both the grammar and pragmatics subsystems, I will propose
a fine structure of the preferential interpretation in pragmatics in
terms of defeasible rule interactions. The pronoun interpretation
preferences that serve as the empirical ground draw from the survey
data specifically obtained for the present purpose.
