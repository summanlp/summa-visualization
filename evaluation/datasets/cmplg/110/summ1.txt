We present an analysis of the semantic interpretation of intensional
verbs such as seek that allows them to take direct objects of
either individual or quantifier type, producing both de dicto
and de re readings in the quantifier case, all without needing
to stipulate type-raising or quantifying-in rules.  This simple
account follows directly from our use of logical deduction in
linear logic to express the relationship between syntactic structures
and meanings.  While our analysis resembles current categorial
approaches in important ways
 (,,,), it differs from them in allowing the greater type flexibility of
 categorial semantics () while maintaining a precise connection to syntax. As a result, we are able to provide
derivations for certain readings of sentences with intensional verbs
and complex direct objects that are not derivable in current purely
categorial accounts of the syntax-semantics interface.  The analysis
forms a part of our ongoing work on semantic interpretation within the
framework of Lexical-Functional Grammar.
