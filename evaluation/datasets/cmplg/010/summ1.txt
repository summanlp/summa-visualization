Few, if any, current NLP systems make any significant use
of punctuation. Intuitively, a treatment of punctuation seems
necessary to the analysis and production of text. Whilst this
has been suggested in the fields of discourse structure, it is still
unclear whether punctuation can help in the syntactic field.
This investigation attempts to answer this question by parsing
some corpus-based material with two similar grammars -- one
including rules for punctuation, the other ignoring it. The
punctuated grammar significantly out-performs the
unpunctuated one, and so the conclusion is that punctuation
can play a useful role in syntactic processing.
