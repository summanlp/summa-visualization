Several research projects around the world are building grammatically
analysed corpora; that is, collections of text annotated with part-of-speech
wordtags and syntax trees. However, projects have used quite different
wordtagging and parsing schemes.
Developers of corpora adhere to a variety of competing
models or theories of grammar and parsing, with the effect of restricting the
accessibility of their respective corpora, and the potential for collation
into a single fully parsed corpus.
In view of this heterogeneity, we have begun to investigate
and develop methods
of automatically mapping between the annotation schemes of the most widely
known corpora, thus assessing their differences and improving their
reusability.
Annotating a single corpus with the different schemes allows
for comparisons and will provide a rich test-bed for automatic parsers.
Collation of all the included corpora into a single large annotated corpus
will provide a more detailed language model to be developed for tasks
such as speech and handwriting recognition.
This paper focuses on methods of developing mappings between tagsets and,
in particular, the method of automatic extraction of mappings from corpora
tagged with more than one annotation scheme.
