We present a system for the investigation of computational
  properties of categorial grammar parsing based on a labelled
  analytic tableaux theorem prover. This proof method allows us to
  take a modular approach, in which the basic grammar can be kept
  constant, while a range of categorial calculi can be captured by
  assigning different properties to the labelling algebra. The theorem
  proving strategy is particularly well suited to the treatment of
  categorial grammar, because it allows us to distribute the
  computational cost between the algorithm which deals with the
  grammatical types and the algebraic checker which constrains the
  derivation.
