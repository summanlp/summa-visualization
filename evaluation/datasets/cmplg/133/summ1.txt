A description is an entity that can be interpreted as true or false of
an object, and using feature structures as descriptions accrues
several computational benefits.  In this paper, I create an explicit
interpretation of a typed feature structure used as a description,
define the notion of a satisfiable feature structure, and create a
simple and effective algorithm to decide if a feature structure is
satisfiable.
