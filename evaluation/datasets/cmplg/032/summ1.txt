This paper addresses the issue of defining context, and more specifically
the different contexts needed for understanding a particular type of texts.
The corpus chosen is homogeneous and allows us to determine characteristic
properties of the texts from which certain inferences can be drawn by the
reader.  These characteristic properties come from the real world domain
(K-context), the type of events the texts describe (F-context) and the genre
of the texts (E-context).  Together, these three contexts provide elements
for the resolution of anaphoric expressions and for several types of
disambiguation.  We show in particular that the argumentation aspect of
these texts is an essential part of the context and explains some of the
inferences that can be drawn.
