We present an automatic method for weighting the contributions
of preference functions used in disambiguation.  Initial scaling factors
are derived as the solution to a least-squares minimization problem,
and improvements are then made by hill-climbing.  The method is
applied to disambiguating sentences in the ATIS (Air Travel
Information System) corpus, and the performance of the resulting
scaling factors is compared with hand-tuned factors. We then focus on
one class of preference function, those based on semantic lexical
collocations. Experimental results are presented showing that such
functions vary considerably in selecting correct analyses. In particular
we define a function that performs significantly better than ones based
on mutual information and likelihood ratios of lexical associations.
