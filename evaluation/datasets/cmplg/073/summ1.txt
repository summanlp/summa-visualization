The important part of semantics of complex sentence is captured as
relations among semantic roles in subordinate and main clause
respectively.  However if there can be relations between every pair of
semantic roles, the amount of computation to identify the relations that
hold in the given sentence is extremely large. In this paper, for
semantics of Japanese complex sentence, we introduce new pragmatic roles
called observer and motivated respectively to bridge
semantic roles of subordinate and those of main clauses. By these new
roles constraints on the relations among semantic/pragmatic roles are
known to be almost local within subordinate or main clause. In other
words, as for the semantics of the whole complex sentence, the only role
we should deal with is a motivated.
