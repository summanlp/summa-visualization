Natural language generation must work with insufficient input.
Underspecifications can be caused by shortcomings of the component  providing the
input or by the preliminary state of incrementally given input. The paper aims
to escape from such dead-end situations by making assumptions. We discuss global
aspects of default handling. Two problem classes for defaults in the
incremental syntactic generator VM-GEN are presented to substantiate
our discussion.
