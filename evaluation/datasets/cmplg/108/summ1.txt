In dialogues in which both agents are autonomous, each agent
deliberates whether to accept or reject the contributions of the
current speaker. A speaker cannot simply assume that a proposal or an
assertion will be accepted. However, an examination of a corpus of
naturally-occurring problem-solving dialogues shows that agents often
do not explicitly indicate acceptance or rejection.  Rather the
speaker must infer whether the hearer understands and accepts the
current contribution based on indirect evidence provided by the
hearer's next dialogue contribution. In this paper, I propose a model
of the role of informationally redundant utterances in providing
evidence to support inferences about mutual understanding and
acceptance.  The model (1) requires a theory of mutual belief that
supports mutual beliefs of various strengths; (2) explains the
function of a class of informationally redundant utterances that
cannot be explained by other accounts; and (3) contributes to a theory
of dialogue by showing how mutual beliefs can be inferred in the
absence of the master-slave assumption.
