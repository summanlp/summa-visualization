We address the problem of automatically constructing a thesaurus by
  clustering words based on corpus data. We view this problem as that
  of estimating a joint distribution over the Cartesian product of a
  partition of a set of nouns and a partition of a set of verbs, and
  propose a learning algorithm based on the Minimum Description Length
  (MDL) Principle for such estimation. We empirically compared the
  performance of our method based on the MDL Principle against the
  Maximum Likelihood Estimator in word clustering, and found that the
  former outperforms the latter. We also evaluated the method by
  conducting pp-attachment disambiguation experiments using an
  automatically constructed thesaurus. Our experimental results
  indicate that such a thesaurus can be used to improve accuracy in
  disambiguation.
