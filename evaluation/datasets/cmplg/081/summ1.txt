Spoken language processing requires speech and natural language
integration. Moreover, spoken Korean calls for unique processing
methodology due to its linguistic characteristics. This paper presents
SKOPE, a connectionist/symbolic spoken Korean processing engine, which
emphasizes that: 1) connectionist and symbolic techniques must be selectively
applied according to their relative strength and weakness, and  2) the
linguistic
characteristics of Korean must be fully considered for phoneme recognition,
speech and language integration, and morphological/syntactic processing.
The design and implementation of SKOPE demonstrates how connectionist/symbolic
hybrid architectures can be constructed for spoken agglutinative language
processing.  Also SKOPE
presents many novel ideas for speech and language processing. The phoneme
recognition, morphological analysis, and syntactic analysis
experiments show that SKOPE is a viable approach for the spoken Korean
processing.
