We propose a bottom-up variant of Earley deduction. Bottom-up deduction
is preferable to top-down deduction because it allows incremental
processing (even for head-driven grammars), it is data-driven, no
subsumption check is needed, and preference values attached to lexical
items can be used to guide best-first search. We discuss the scanning
step for bottom-up Earley deduction and indexing schemes that
help avoid useless deduction steps.
