We present a new method for characterizing the interpretive
possibilities generated by elliptical constructions in natural
language.  Unlike previous analyses, which postulate ambiguity of
interpretation or derivation in the full clause source of the
ellipsis, our analysis requires no such hidden ambiguity.  Further,
the analysis follows relatively directly from an abstract statement of
the ellipsis interpretation problem.  It predicts correctly a wide
range of interactions between ellipsis and other semantic phenomena
such as quantifier scope and bound anaphora.  Finally, although the
analysis itself is stated nonprocedurally, it admits of a direct
computational method for generating interpretations.
