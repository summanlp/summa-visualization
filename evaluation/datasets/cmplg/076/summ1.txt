This
  paper is concerned with the detection and correction of
  sub-sentential English text errors.  Previous spelling programs,
  unless restricted to a very small set of words, have operated as
  post-processors.  And to date, grammar checkers and other programs
  which deal with ill-formed input usually step directly from spelling
  considerations to a full-scale parse, assuming a complete sentence.
  Work described below is aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of
  shallow (sub-sentential) processing and the feasibility of
  cooperative error checking, through building and testing
  appropriately an error-processing system.  A system under
  construction is outlined which incorporates morphological checks
  (using new two-level error rules) over a directed letter graph, tag
  positional trigrams and partial parsing.  Intended testing is
  discussed.
