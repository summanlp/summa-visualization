The paper describes a substitutional approach to ellipsis resolution giving
 comparable results to , but without the need for order-sensitive interleaving of quantifier scoping and
ellipsis resolution. It is argued that the order-independence results
from viewing semantic interpretation as building  a description of a semantic
composition, instead of the more common view of interpretation as actually
performing the composition.
