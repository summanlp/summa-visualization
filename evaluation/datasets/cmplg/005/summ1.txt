We rely on the strength of linguistic and philosophical perspectives
in constructing a framework that offers a unified explanation for
presuppositions and existential commitment.  We use a rich ontology
and a set of methodological principles that embed the essence of
Meinong's philosophy and Grice's conversational principles into a
stratified logic, under an unrestricted interpretation of the
quantifiers. The result is a logical formalism that yields a tractable
computational method that uniformly calculates all the presuppositions
of a given utterance, including the existential ones.
