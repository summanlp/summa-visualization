<TITLE>Semantics of Complex Sentences in Japanese</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
<P>
The important part of semantics of complex sentence is captured as
relations among semantic roles in subordinate and main clause
respectively.  However if there can be relations between every pair of
semantic roles, the amount of computation to identify the relations that
hold in the given sentence is extremely large. In this paper, for
semantics of Japanese complex sentence, we introduce new pragmatic roles
called observer and motivated respectively to bridge
semantic roles of subordinate and those of main clauses. By these new
roles constraints on the relations among semantic/pragmatic roles are
known to be almost local within subordinate or main clause. In other
words, as for the semantics of the whole complex sentence, the only role
we should deal with is a motivated.

<BODY>
<DIV ID="1" DEPTH="1" R-NO="1"><HEADER>  Introduction </HEADER>
<P>
Our aim is to formalize constraints that are needed to develop a
parser based on unification grammar (called ``UG'' henceforth) so that
our parser can deal with variety of types of sentences in Japanese.
However just parsing syntactically is not enough for natural language
understanding.  One important and necessary task to be done, when a
parser processes a discourse in Japanese, is the so called zero
anaphora resolution.  All of syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic
constraints are to be involved to resolve zero anaphora.  Of course, some
of omitted pronouns are syntactically resolved. For instance, VP with
suffix te is not regarded as a clause but a conjunct VP.
Therefore the subject of the VP with te, which is possibly
omitted from surface, should corefer with the subject of the sentence.
One example is
</P>
<P>
`Hanako felt  cold and closed the window.'
</P>
<P>
where both of zero subjects 
<!-- MATH: $\phi_{1subj}$ -->
<EQN/>
and 
<!-- MATH: $\phi_{2subj}$ -->
 <EQN/>  refer to the sentential topic Hanako
  .  In this example, one of the possible accounts for this
interpretation is the following. Zero subject of -te phrase is [ +
 anaphoric, + pronominal ] or PRO in GB term <REF/>. As the result, 
<!-- MATH: $\phi_{1subj}$ -->
<EQN/>
is controlled by the subject 
<!-- MATH: $\phi_{2subj}$ -->
<EQN/>of the main VP, which is also zero subject.  
<!-- MATH: $\phi_{2subj}$ -->
<EQN/>
is, in GB
term, [ - anaphoric, + pronominal ] or pro.  The sentential
topic Hanako is the only possible antecedent of this zero
subject in this example.  However, in complex sentences, things are
quite different.  Consider the following sentence.
</P>
<P>
1. `Since Hanako behaved like feeling cold, I closed the window.'
2. `Since I behaved like feeling cold, Hanako closed the window.'
</P>
<P>
If contextually we can take only Hanako and the speaker of this sentence
as candidates of antecedent of 
<!-- MATH: $\phi_{1subj}$ -->
<EQN/>
or 
<!-- MATH: $\phi_{2subj}$ -->
<EQN/>,
intuitively the following two interpretations are equally likely.
</P>
<P>
a.
<!-- MATH: $\phi_{1subj}$ -->
<EQN/>
= Hanako, 
<!-- MATH: $\phi_{2subj}$ -->
<EQN/>
= speaker
b.
<!-- MATH: $\phi_{1subj}$ -->
<EQN/>
= speaker, 
<!-- MATH: $\phi_{2subj}$ -->
<EQN/>
= Hanako
</P>
<P>
Therefore 
<!-- MATH: $\phi_{1subj}$ -->
<EQN/>
and 
<!-- MATH: $\phi_{2subj}$ -->
<EQN/>
are both pro. In fact this
fact is well known among Japanese linguists, i.e.
 <REF/>,<REF/>.  As a result, zero anaphora resolution of complex sentence is not only to be done syntactically, but also to be done
pragmatically and/or semantically.  One of the promising candidate for
 this is the centering theory <REF/>,<REF/>.  To apply the centering theory that is originally for a sequence of sentences, namely
discourse, we regard the subordinate clause and the main clause as
a segment of discourse respectively. Moreover Hanako who is marked by
`wa' is regarded as the topic for these two clauses. Then, the topic
Hanako is the strongest candidate for the backward center of the
subordinate clause. Therefore the backward center of the subordinate
clause is Hanako, and consequently zero subject 
<!-- MATH: $\phi_{1subj}$ -->
<EQN/>
refers to
Hanako. By the same way as the subordinate clause case is dealt with,
the zero subject of the main clause 
<!-- MATH: $\phi_{2subj}$ -->
<EQN/>
is known to refer to
Hanako, too. This result is neither interpretation a nor b
shown above. Another candidate is the property sharing thoery
 <REF/>. In her theory, since the both of zero subjects share the subjecthood, both of them finally are known to refer to Hanako that
is the topic for both of these clauses. Therefore the property sharing
theory also fails to account for the intuitive interpretations.
</P>
<P>
Then we shift our attention to more microscopic one, in
which ,roughly speaking, the important part of semantics of complex
sentence is formalized as relations among semantic roles that appear in
the main clause or the subordinate clause. At the first glance, the
constraints about these relations are not local in terms of main or
subordinate clauses. In other words, semantic roles that appear in
subordinate clause and semantic roles that appear in the main clause
seem to be directly constrained by the constraints of complex sentence.
However, looking more carefully, we find that the constraints of
subordinate clause and the constraints of main clause are represented as
local constraints by introducing the new notion of motivated which
is characterized as a person who has enough reason to act as the main
clause describes.  More precisely, motivated is one of the
pragmatic roles that appear in a subordinate clause, and the constraints
in subordinate clause are stated as identity relations between motivated and other semantic/pragmatic roles appearing in subordinate
clause.  Therefore these constraints are local in subordinate clause.
The constraints in main clause are stated as identity relations between
motivated which comes from subordinate clause, and other semantic
roles appearing in main clause.  Therefore in understanding the main
clause we don't have to be care about semantic/pragmatic roles in
subordinate clause other than a motivated. In this sense, the
constraints in the main clause can be treated as almost local
constraints of the main clause.
</P>
<P>
The next question is how to represent the semantics of complex sentence
in feature structure( called FS henceforth ).  For this, we should write
down the constraints about these relations among semantic/pragmatic
roles in a feature structure formalism.
Due to the space limitation, in this
paper we mainly pursue the constraints about semantic feature
structures.
</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="2" DEPTH="1" R-NO="2"><HEADER>  Hierarchical Structure of Complex Sentence </HEADER>
<P>
We pay our attention to the general structure of Japanese utterance
which is helpful to represent semantics of complex sentence.  Several
Japanese linguists have already proposed the general structure of
 Japanese utterances <REF/>,<REF/>,<REF/>,<REF/>. Mikami categorized clauses into three classes, namely `open', `semi-open' and
`closed.' This categorization indicates how freely the content of
clause interacts with the outside of clause. For instance, they are
categorized by the degree of possibilities of coreference between zero
pronouns inside the subordinate clause and nominal or topic that
appear in the main clause. Following Mikami's idea, Minami proposed
four levels, namely level A, B, C and D which correspond roughly to
VP, proposition, sentence without communication mood and utterance
which takes into account a hearer, respectively.
 <REF/> divided level A into two levels. One of them corresponds to VP, the other corresponds to VP + a certain
kind of subject which is called ``objective subject.''
Gunji proposed the more detailed structure, in which starting from
predicate, say, verb and adjective, objects, voice,
subject, aspect, tense, modality, topic and mood are or
might be sequentially added to make an informationally more fulfilled
sentence component. Finally, it ends up with an utterance. In Gunji's
structure, some node can have more than two daughter nodes to make
more complex sentence. Following them, the structure of the so called
(cluase level) complex sentence is the following shown in
Fig.1.
</P>
<P>
In Fig.1 , Sub-Clause and Conjunct mean subordinate clause and
conjunctive particle respectively.  Note that Fig.1 represents not only
the hierarchical structure but also the word order of a complex sentence
in Japanese. The structure is almost the same as Gunji's structure
except for explicitly showing complex proposition, subordinate-clause
and conjunctive-particle that are newly added to deal with complex
sentences. Note that `Comment' appearing in `Sub-Clause' has the same
structure as `Comment' appearing just below `Judgement'. That is to say,
`Comment' is recursively defined. However, in practice, the more the
level of depth of recursively appearing `Comment' is, the less
comprehensible the sentence is.
</P>
<P>
<EQN/>
</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="3" DEPTH="1" R-NO="3"><HEADER>  Subordinate Clause </HEADER>
<P>
In this section, at first we show the predicate categories used in the
subordinate clauses that we deal with in this paper, in
 Table.<CREF/>. 
In each category of 2,3,4,5 and 6,
exists there a person who is affected by the situation described by
the subordinate clause.  On the contrary, in category 1, there is
not necessarily an explicit affected person. In our theory, this
affected person plays a key role for semantics of complex sentence. As
the result, in general we cannot derive a useful result for category 1
 in our theory.  Therefore we don't deal with category 1
in this paper.
</P>
<P>
At this moment, we should explain the nature of the so called subjective
 predicate mentioned in Table.<CREF/>.  In short a subjective predicate describes the experiencer's inner state which can
exclusively be known by the experiencer him/herself.
</P>
<P>
Next we focus on verbal suffix garu. Firstly we show garu's syntax. Garu is the present form and its root form is
gar. Therefore inflections are as follows: gar-re,gar-i, etc. In addition, garu has an allophonic
root form gat and, gat-ta(past-form), gat-teiru(progressive-form) and so on are derived from gat.
Some of these forms will appear in our examples.  Next we talk about
the semantics of garu.  Garu roughly means ``show a sign
 of'' or ``behave like ..ing''<REF/>.  Also in <REF/> its semantics is informally explained, however our proposal is to
formalize garu's semantics in UG or more generally in
computational linguistics.  For this, first of all, we introduce a new
pragmatic role called observer.
</P>
<P>
Definition  1 (Observer)    
Observer is a person who directly observes or is indirectly informed the
situation described by the proposition part. Therefore an observer has a
certain evidence to be convinced that that situation actually happens.
</P>
<P>
Although this notion of observer shares a large part with PIVOT of
 <REF/>, our notion of observer is introduced only by garu.  Therefore it is much narrower notion.  As you will see later, this newly introduced role is playing a key role which bridges semantic
roles of subordinate clause to semantic roles of main clause.
</P>
<P>
As for an observer introduced by garu, one of the widely
known consequence about the nature of subjective predicate is the
following. In a sentence, if a subjective adjective is used without
being followed by a verbal suffix
garu, the experiencer of the subjective adjective should be the
speaker of the sentence.
</P>
<P>
The next thing we should do about a newly introduced notion of observer is to make clear the way to deal with it in FS. First of all,
in our FS, a semantic content:SEM is basically a soa (state of affair)
form of situation semantics. However we use semantic role like ``agent'', ``patient'', ``experiencer'', and so on, as
argument roles of soa.  Since an observer observes the situation
which is characterized by a soa, if we know that there exists an observer, the observed soa is embedded in observing situation, which,
in turn, is embedded in the whole semantic content. In this sense, the
observed soa's argument role is observed.  But as far as we have
no confusion, we omit role name `observed' henceforth.  A typical schema
of SEM of FS of this type is the following. Note that we use garu
as a value of the relation feature meant by `rel.' The English gross of
this relation garu is `observe.'
</P>
<P>
SEM =
rel: garu
         observer:<EQN/>#11
         soa:rel:Ragent:<EQN/>#12experiencer:<EQN/>#13
                             patient:<EQN/>#14....
</P>
<P>
Now we explain the semantics of clause which consists of subjective
adjective with garu or ta-garu, that are in categories
4 and 5.
These categories' forms are ``
<!-- MATH: $\phi_{exp}$ -->
<EQN/>
P-garu'' or its past form
``
<!-- MATH: $\phi_{exp}$ -->
<EQN/>
P-gat-ta'', where P is a subjective adjective (category
 4 in Table.<CREF/>) or is a verb followed by ta-gar (category  5 in Table.<CREF/>), and  <!-- MATH: $\phi_{exp}$ -->
<EQN/>
is the experiencer of P which
is possibly zero. In these categories, there exist observers who are
not the experiencer of P, and observe that experience. The
SEM feature of ``
<!-- MATH: $\phi_{exp}$ -->
<EQN/>
P-garu/gat-ta'' is the following.
</P>
<P>
rel:garuobserver:<EQN/>#11
where <EQN/>
<EQN/>
<EQN/>
soa:rel:Pexp:<EQN/>#13
</P>
<P>
where `` <EQN/>
'' means ``not token
identical.''
</P>
<P>
In our FS, constraints for tokens like <EQN/>
are written with
``where'' as shown in this FS. Since constraint satisfaction method in
UG has been and is developed by many researchers recently i.e.
 <REF/>, our theory will be able to be implemented in systems like theirs.
</P>
<P>
If the sentence finishes just after ``garu/gat-ta'', the important
points are 1) an introduced observer is the speaker, and
consequently 2) the experiencer cannot be the speaker. If a clause
with ``garu/gat-ta''is a subordinate clause, the experiencer
cannot be identified with a semantic role corresponding to the subject
of main clause or higher clause.
</P>
<P>
As for category 2, subjective verbs like ``kurusimu''(feel sick) and
``kanasimu''(feel sadness) that describe subjective and/or emotional
experience in verb form, are used.  Like the case of garu, an
observer who observers the experience can be introduced.  However this
observer is not obligatory. Therefore unlike the ``garu/gat-ta'' case,
the experiencer also can be an obligatory semantic role of higher
clause as well as the speaker.

According to the hierachical structure of Japanese sentence shown in
Fig.1 , the essential part of hierarchical structure of the
 following sentence (<CREF/>) is shown in Fig.2 .  In this figure, the structure just below each proposition is replaced with the
corresponding parts of sentence.

<P>
Basically the embedding structure of FS corresponds to the hierarchy
shown in the hierarchical structure Fig.1 . To grasp the
image of the relation between a hierarchical structure and the
corresponding FS, we show an example of FS of the above complex
 sentence (<CREF/>) analyzed based on this hierarchical structure in the following.  This FS is the result of the unification between
the FSs of subordinate clause and main clause, where the contents of
syntactic feature HEAD , namely
<!-- MATH: $\fbox{syn}$ -->
<EQN/>
is omitted.

</P>
<P>
where English grosses of relation name is the following: sime:`close',
node:`because', samu-i:`feel cold'.
</P>
<P>
The key point of the semantics of complex sentence is the role motivated that appears in 
<!-- MATH: $\fbox{sub-sem}$ -->
<EQN/>
which corresponds to the
content of the subordinate clause. The role motivated is the link
between the content of subordinate clause and the main clause.
Semantically motivated is characterized as the following.
</P>
<P>
Definition  2 (Motivated)    
Motivated is a person who is affected by the situation described
by the subordinate clause deeply enough to feel or act as the main
clause describes.
</P>
<P>
The important and indispensable part of semantics of complex sentence
is, roughly speaking, the relation between a subordinate clause and
the main clause. But if you look more closely, this relation is
actually the relations among semantic/pragmatic roles appearing in the
subordinate clause and those appearing in the main clause. The newly
introduced role of motivated gives the most important clue for
this relation. Therefore, in the rest of this paper, our effort will
be concentrated into whom a motivated refers to. More precisely,
in FS, our main concerns are which semantic role in the SEM
of subordinate clause the motivated can or cannot be unified
with, and which semantic role in the SEM of main clause the
motivated can or cannot be unified with.
</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="4.2" DEPTH="2" R-NO="2"><HEADER>  Constraints </HEADER>
<P>
In this subsection, we propose the constraints on complex sentence.  For
this, at first we categorize the relations between subordinate clause
and main clause based on their semantics. They are divided up to many
types of complex sentence. We show the most important and typical types
 in Table.<CREF/>, where SC and MC mean `subordinate clause' and `main clause' respectively.  In this table, the first column is for a
name of sentence type, the second column indicates a rough meaning of
the relation between subordinate clause SC and main clause MC of complex
sentence, and the third column shows Japanese conjunctive particles used
to represent a type of complex sentence in the same row.
</P>
<P>
Three VP adjuncts, te, tutu, and nagara, are
usually used to express events ocurring simultaneously. However, if they
are used with aspectual suffix i which means perfective, for
instance i-nagara, they are regarded as clause conjuncts and are to
 be interpreted as `although'<REF/>.  We don't deal with type 4, because a temporal adverbial clause just describes an event that occurs
before, simultaneously or after another event which is described by the
main clause.  Therefore generally we don't expect essential information
for relations among semantic roles appearing in adverbial or main clause
from this type of sentence.
</P>
<P>
Now we focus on type 1,2 and 3, where a motivated plays the key role
 in the constraints. In Table.<CREF/> we show the constraints that  say which semantic/pragmatic role of subordinate clause can be a motivated. Table.<CREF/> shows which semantic role of main clause can be unified with the motivated.  In these tables, the first
column of the first row is for constraint names, the second column shows
a set of sentence types for which the constraints shown in the second
 row apply.  The third column of Table.<CREF/> shows predicate patterns of subordinate clause, and the third column of
 Table.<CREF/> shows semantic categories of predicate of main clause. For them, constraints written in the second row apply.  Note
 that all of these constraints in Table.<CREF/> are local in a subordinate clause, because both sides of = of constraints are roles of
subordinate clause.  In case of subjective adjective without garu,
the constraint `motivated = experiencer' holds also for type
1 except for the case where directionally auxiliary verb ``yaru(give)'',
``kureru(be given)''  are used. Analysis for these cases is one of
our future problem.
</P>
<P>
 As for Table.<CREF/>,  <!-- MATH: $\mbox{state}^\ast$ -->
<EQN/>
is a state except for the
case that there exists a third party who is a motivated puts the
experiencer into that state. For instance, the experiencer
is permitted to do something by the motivated. Since in this kind
of case things are quite complicated, we omit it here because of the
 limited space.  Constraints in Table.<CREF/> are also local in a main clause because every semantic role that appeares in the righthand
side of the constraints is defined within the main clause. Needless to
say, the influence from a subordinate clause comes only via role motivated.
</P>
<P>
where `name' means a name of each constraint.
</P>
<P>
In the rest of this section we show the examples that exemplify these
constraints.
</P>
<P>
 First, we take (<CREF/>) of type 1. The constraints to be applied are S1 and M1 as you know from the contents of subordinate and main
clause. By combination of S1 and M1, zero agent of main
clause:
<!-- MATH: $\phi_{agt}$ -->
<EQN/>
is the observer of the situation described by
the subordinate clause, where 
<!-- MATH: $\phi_{exp}$ -->
<EQN/>
behaved like feeling cold.
This interpretation coincides with native's intuition.
</P>
<P>
Look at the following pair of example.
</P>
<P>
`Although 
<!-- MATH: $\phi_{exp}$ -->
<EQN/>
behaved like feeling bad, 
<!-- MATH: $\phi_{agt}$ -->
<EQN/>
didn't take a
medicine at last.'
</P>
<P>
`Although 
<!-- MATH: $\phi_{exp}$ -->
<EQN/>
wanted to stay, 
<!-- MATH: $\phi_{agt}$ -->
<EQN/>
finally forced him out.'
</P>
<P>
 In both of (<CREF/>) and (<CREF/>), the motivateds of subordinate clause are constrained by S2, namely motivateds can be
either 
<!-- MATH: $\phi_{exp}$ -->
<EQN/>
or the observer of subordinate clause.
Constraint M1 says that in both cases, 
<!-- MATH: $\phi_{agt}$ -->
<EQN/>
is unified with the
 motivated. Intuitively in (<CREF/>),  <!-- MATH: $\phi_{agt}$ -->
<EQN/>
is
<!-- MATH: $\phi_{exp}$ -->
<EQN/>.
 On the other hand in (<CREF/>),  <!-- MATH: $\phi_{agt}$ -->
<EQN/>
is the
observer. Both of these interpretations comply with constraints
S2, and M1.
`Since it is hot, I am in trouble.'
</P>
<P>
Intuitively 
<!-- MATH: $\phi_{1exp}$ -->
<EQN/>
corefer with 
<!-- MATH: $\phi_{2exp}$ -->
<EQN/>.
This
interpretation is expected by constraint S3 and M2 that apply in this
case. As you know from these examples, our constraints are not strong
enough to identify the antecedent of 
<!-- MATH: $\phi_{agt}$ -->
<EQN/>
uniquely, but makes
safe interpretations.  Moreover disambiguation done by these
constraints is useful for further inference that will be done with
commonsense knowledge or with a special vocabulary like
 `kekkyoku(finally)' used in (<CREF/>). 
</P>
<P>
In case of S5, namely intransitive passive or adversity passive, it is
well known, i.e.
 <REF/> that there exists a person who is affected by the situation described by the passive sentence. An example sentence is
the following.
</P>
<P>
`Although his wife had gone, 
<!-- MATH: $\phi_{exp}$ -->
<EQN/>
doesn't show a bit of sadness.
</P>
<P>
 The semantic role of this affected person , in (<CREF/>) zero  role:
<!-- MATH: $\phi_{affect}$ -->
<EQN/>
whose wife was dead, is an affected.
The intuitive interpretation that 
<!-- MATH: $\phi_{exp} = \phi_{affect} (= {\it
motivated})$ -->
<EQN/>,
 is expected by our constraints: S5 of Table.<CREF/>  and M1 of Table.<CREF/>. On the contrary, in case of S6, namely transitive passive, generally we don't have an affected.
However in some context, a transitive passive form may require the
role affected which is inherent to adversity passive.
For instance,
`
<!-- MATH: $\phi_{affect}$ -->
<EQN/>'s wallet was stolen.'
</P>
<P>
In this case, a person whose wallet was stolen is not explicit but
regarded as an affected.  Another case having an affected
is that a relational noun is the subject of transitive passive. Then a
person who is in the relation expressed by the relational noun is
thought to be affected by that situation ,too.  Here we take `mother',
`father', `daughter', `son', `supervisor', and so forth as a
relational noun. A couple of example sentences are the following.
</P>
<P>
`Since his henchman was attacked, the boss retaliated.'
</P>
<P>
`Although his henchman was attacked, the boss didn't retaliate.'
</P>
<P>
<!-- MATH: $\phi_{agt}$ -->
<EQN/>
 who retaliated (<CREF/>) (or didn't retaliate  (<CREF/>)) has a certain relation between the henchman who had been attacked. For instance, 
<!-- MATH: $\phi_{agt}$ -->
<EQN/>
may be the boss of that
 henchman. In (<CREF/>), since constraint S6 of  Table.<CREF/> and M1 of Table.<CREF/> apply,  <!-- MATH: $\phi_{agt}$ -->
<EQN/>
is
an affected of attacking event described in the subordinate
clause. This interpretation coincides with native's intuition.
</P>
<P>
In sum, with these constraints, a constraint satisfaction
process in UG based parsing can be done locally and consequently very
efficiently.  In other words, primarily a constraint satisfaction
process of a subordinate clause can be done within the analysis of
subordinate clause, and that of the main clause can be done within it
except for using motivated whose value has already been constrained
in the subordinate clause.

<DIV ID="5" DEPTH="1" R-NO="5"><HEADER>  Related Works and Conclusions </HEADER>
<P>
One of the relevant researches to ours is JPSG that has been developed by
 Gunji<REF/>,<REF/> and is further studied by the ICOT working group. Our focus is a more pragmatics oriented one than JPSG is.
Many Japanese linguists have already done the enormous amount of basic
observations and proposed linguistic theories about the phenomena we
deal with in this paper
 <REF/>,<REF/>,<REF/>,<REF/>,<REF/>,<REF/>,<REF/>,<REF/>,<REF/>. Of course our research is based on their works and observations. In
 <REF/>, it is said that if garu is used in a subordinate clause, the subject of the main clause is not the experiencer of the
subordinate clause. In
 <REF/>, she says that 1) a cognizer that corresponds to our observer is introduced if garu is used, and 2) if an observer is introduced in the subordinate clause, the mentally
responsible person appearing in the main clause is identical with the
observer. In linguistic phenomena, these observations are
similar to the constraint we propose here. So what is new? The answer
is that: 1) We explicitly state the semantics of complex sentence as
the relations among semantic roles.  Namely, since we use semantic/pragmatic
roles instead of grammatical roles in constraints, our constraints can
account for zero anaphora in a sentence where the main clause is
passive where an agent or an experiencer is not
necessarily the subject, like the following example.
`Since Taro behaved like hating to go to school, he was scolded.' 
where the intuitive reading is the following: 
<!-- MATH: $\phi_{pat}$ -->
<EQN/>,
that is zero
subject, refers to Taro, and 
<!-- MATH: $\phi_{agt}$ -->
<EQN/>,
that is not the zero subject,
refers to Taro's parents who are the observer and motivated
of the subordinate clause.  2) We formalize this theory in UG formalism,
even though the details are omitted due to the space limitation. 3) We
find that the constraints of complex sentences are actually local ones.
This localization of constraint was found by introducing new pragmatic
roles observer and motivated, and is extremely important for
efficiency of UG based parsing. This localization also makes the
proposed constraints be compositional ones, because in the case of
deeply embedded complex sentence to identify the referent of each motivated that bridges between a subordinate clause and its main
clause, the constraints we proposed are resolved with computation
confined within each clause.
