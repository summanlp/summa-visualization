paper are simplified still further for expositional purposes.
  Or the principal anchor node, in constructions which have
more than one lexical anchor.
  The parent is not a leaf of the entire tree, of
course, but it is a leaf of the subtree above the current node.
  To gain a superficial understanding of this
fragment, read a line such as [] == INTRANS_VERB as ``inherit everything from the definition of .'', and a line such as
[parent] == PP_TREE:[] as ``inherit the  subtree
from the definition of PP_TREE.'' Inheritance is always
default - locally defined feature specifications take priority over
inherited ones.
