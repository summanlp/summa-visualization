We describe a method for analysing the temporal structure of
a discourse which takes into account the effects of tense, aspect,
temporal adverbials and rhetorical structure and which minimises
unnecessary ambiguity in the temporal structure.  It is part of a
discourse grammar
implemented in Carpenter's  ALE formalism.
The method for building up the temporal structure of the discourse
combines constraints and preferences: we use constraints to reduce the
number of possible structures, exploiting the  HPSG type hierarchy and
unification for this purpose; and we apply preferences to choose
between the remaining options using a temporal centering mechanism.
We end by recommending that an underspecified representation of the structure
using these techniques be used to avoid generating the temporal/rhetorical
structure until higher-level information can be used to disambiguate.
