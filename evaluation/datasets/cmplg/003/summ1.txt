Pulman has shown that Higher-Order Unification (HOU) can
be used to model the interpretation of focus. In this
paper, we extend the unification-based approach to cases which are
often seen as a test-bed for focus theory: utterances with multiple
focus operators and second occurrence expressions. We then show that the
resulting analysis favourably compares with two prominent theories of
focus (namely, Rooth's Alternative Semantics and Krifka's Structured
Meanings theory) in that it correctly generates interpretations which
these alternative theories cannot yield.  Finally, we discuss the
formal properties of the approach and argue that even though HOU need
not terminate, for the class of unification-problems dealt with in
this paper, HOU avoids this shortcoming and is in fact computationally
tractable.
