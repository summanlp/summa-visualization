Possessive pronouns are used as determiners in English when no
  equivalent would be used in a Japanese sentence with the same
  meaning.  This paper proposes a heuristic method of generating such
  possessive pronouns even when there is no equivalent in the
  Japanese.  The method uses information about the use of possessive
  pronouns in English treated as a lexical property of nouns, in
  addition to contextual information about noun phrase referentiality
  and the subject and main verb of the sentence that the noun phrase
  appears in.  The proposed method has been implemented in NTT
  Communication Science Laboratories' Japanese-to-English machine
  translation system ALT-J/E.  In a test set of 6,200 sentences,
  the proposed method increased the number of noun phrases with
  appropriate possessive pronouns generated, by 263 to 609, at the
  cost of generating 83 noun phrases with inappropriate possessive
  pronouns.
