This paper presents PROVERB a text planner for
argumentative texts. PROVERBs main feature is that it combines global
hierarchical planning and unplanned organization of text with respect
to local derivation relations in a complementary way.  The former
splits the task of presenting a particular proof into subtasks of
presenting subproofs.  The latter simulates how the next intermediate
conclusion to be presented is chosen under the guidance of the local
focus.
