Within the cooperative parallel grammar project  PARGRAM
(IMS-Stuttgart, Xerox-Palo Alto, Xerox-Grenoble), the analysis and
representation of structures in the grammars must be viewed from a
more global perspective than that of the individual languages (German,
English, French).  One major goal of  PARGRAM is the development
of broad coverage grammars which are also modular and easy to
maintain.  Another major goal is the construction of parallel
analyses for sentences of the same type in German, English, and
French.  If this can be achieved, the problem faced by machine
translation (MT) could be greatly reduced.  Due to the recent
development of a faster and more powerful version of the LFG
(Lexical-Functional-Grammar) based Grammar Writer's Workbench
(Kaplan and Maxwell 1993) at Xerox, the implementation of a
linguistically adequate, broad coverage grammar appears viable.  Given
the flexible projection-based architecture of LFG (Dalrymple et
al. 1995) and the MT approach presented in Kaplan et
 al. (1989), a robust MT system is already in place. 

In this paper, we concentrate on two issues within the broader
perspective of  PARGRAM: the treatment of auxiliaries and the
transparent representation of multiple genitive NPs in German.  These
phenomena represent two areas for which generally accepted proposals
exist, but whose implementation in the context of parallel grammar
development throws up questions as to their wider, crosslinguistic,
feasibility.  With respect to auxiliaries, the standard raising
approach that is usually adopted yields undesirable structural
complexity and results in idiosyncratic, language particular analyses
of the role of auxiliaries.  With regard to genitive NPs, the standard
analysis for German yields structures which are too ambiguous for a
succesful application of machine translation.  The following sections
present a solution in that morphological wellformedness
conditions are stated at a separate component, the morphology
  projection. Furthermore, a representation of argument structure is
implemented that is related to, but not identical to the
representation of grammatical functions.  Language particular
idiosyncratic requirements are thus separated out from the language
universal information required for further semantic interpretation, or
machine translation.

The architecture of LFG assumed here is the ``traditional''
architecture described in Bresnan (1982), as well as the newer
advances within LFG (Dalrymple et al. , 1995). A grammar is viewed as
a set of correspondences expressed in terms of projections
from one level of representation to another.  Two fundamental levels
of representations within LFG are the c(onstitutent)-structure and the
f(unctional)-structure.  The c-structure encodes idiosyncratic phrase
structural properties of a given language, while the f-structure
provides a language universal representation of grammatical functions
(e.g.,  SUBJect,  OBJect), complementation, tense, binding,
etc.  The correspondence between c-structure and f-structure is
not onto or one-to-one, but many-to-one, allowing an abstraction over
idiosyncratic c-structure properties of a language (e.g.,
discontinuous constituents).

In addition, several proposals exploring possible representations of a
s(emantic)-structure have been made over the years (e.g. Halvorsen and
Kaplan (1988), Dalrymple et al.  (1993)).  As the 
realization of a separate semantic component is only planned for the
latter stages within  PARGRAM, no further discussion of possible
formalisms will take place here.  It should be noted, however, that
rudimentary semantic information, such as argument structure
information (lexical semantics), is encoded within the f-structures in
order to facilitate transfer in some cases.  A case in point is
presented in the section on German genitive NPs.  

Auxiliaries have given rise to lively debates concerning their exact
syntactic status (e.g. Chomsky (1957), Ross (1967), Pullum and Wilson
(1977), Akmajian et al. (1979), Gazdar et al. (1982)): are they simply
main verbs with special properties, or should they instantiate a
special category  AUX?  Within current lexical approaches
(Lexical-Functional-Grammar (LFG), Head-driven Phrase Structure
Grammar (HPSG)), auxiliaries (e.g. have, be) and modals
(e.g. must, should) are treated as raising verbs,
which are marked as special in some way: in HPSG through an [
AUX: +] feature (Pollard and Sag 1994), in LFG (Bresnan 1982) by a
 difference in  PRED value.  However, newer work within LFG (Bresnan 1995, T.H. King 1995) has been moving away
from the raising approach towards an analysis where auxiliaries are
elements which contribute to the clause only tense/aspect, agreement,
or voice information, but not a subcategorization frame.  This view is
also in line with approaches within GB (Government-Binding), which see
auxiliaries simply as possible instantiations of the functional
category I (see also Halle and Marantz (1993)). 

The ``traditional'' treatment of auxiliaries in both HPSG (Pollard and Sag
1994) and LFG has its roots in Ross's (1967) proposal to treat
 auxiliaries and modals on a par with main verbs. In particular, auxiliaries are treated as a subclass of raising verbs (e.g. Pollard
and Sag (1994), Falk (1984)).  For example, a simple sentence like (1)
would correspond to the c-structure and f-structure shown in (2)
and (3), respectively. Note that the level of embedding in the
f-structure exactly mirrors the c-structure: each verbal element takes
a complement.  

The main reasons to treat auxiliaries as complement taking verbs in
English are: 1) an account of VP-ellipsis, VP-topicalization, etc. 
follows immediately; 2) restrictions on the nature of the verbal
complement (progressive, past participle, etc.) following the
auxiliary can be stated straightforwardly (Pullum and Wilson (1977),
Akmajian et al. (1979), Gazdar et al. (1982)).  The latter point holds
for German as well, and in fact, without some sort of a hierarchical
structure, stating wellformedness conditions on a string of multiple
auxiliaries becomes wellnigh impossible in light of the greater
ordering possibilities granted by the flexible German word order.
There are also major reasons, however, for not adopting this analysis:
1) linguistic adequacy; 2) unmotivated structural complexity; 3)
non-parallel analyses for predicationally equivalent sentences.
Consider the French equivalent of (-2) in (1).

As argued by Akmajian et al. (1979), crosslinguistic evidence
indicates that elements bearing only tense, mood, or voice should
belong to a distinct syntactic category.  In many languages, like
French or Japanese, the information carried by will (future), or
have (perfect) is realized morphologically rather than
periphrastically.  The analysis in (0) thus effectively claims
that there exists a deep difference in the predicational structure of
 auxiliaries like will and have and the French   aura. This is not desirable from a crosslinguistic point of view, nor is it helpful for MT.  

The approach adopted here is a flat analysis of auxiliaries at
f-structure ((1)).

The auxiliaries wird `will' and haben `have' now only
contribute information as to the overall tense, but do not
subcategorize for complements.  Structural phenomena like VP-ellipsis,
coordination, or topicalization can, however, still be accounted for
in terms of an appropriate embedding at c-structure (cf. (-3)).
The role of auxiliaries in natural language is now adequately modeled,
in particular with respect to a more realistic treatment of tense
(compare (-2) and (0)), as the French (-1) has
 essentially the same f-structure as (0). 

However, the flat f-structure in (0) provides no room for a
statement of selectional requirements, allowing massive overgeneration
(e.g. nothing blocks the presence of two haben in (-4)).
Neither can the particular order of auxiliaries be regulated.  Our
solution takes advantage of LFG's flexible projection-based
architecture by implementing a projection which models the
hierarchical selectional requirements of auxiliaries, yet does not
interfere with the subcategorizational properties of verbs, as would
be the case under a raising analysis.

In LFG, the flexible word order of German is handled via   functional uncertainty, which characterizes long-distance
dependencies without resorting to movement analyses (Netter (1988),
Zaenen and Kaplan (1995)).  As in (0), which illustrates our
alternative solution, functional uncertainty is represented by the
 Kleene Star (*). The annotation on the NPs indicates that they could fulfill the role of any possible grammatical
function (GF), e.g.  SUBJ or  OBJ, and that the level of
embedding ranges from zero to infinite.  With every auxiliary
subcategorizing for an  XCOMP, the two NPs could conceivably be
arguments of three different verbs: wird, haben, or   gedreht.  Thus, the greater structural complexity unnecessarily
increases the search space for the determination of a verb's
arguments. In (0), however, the m-structure is projected from the
c-structure parallel to the f-structure through annotations similar to
 the usual f-structure annotations. Statements about ``morphological'' dependents ( DEP) are thus decoupled from
functional uncertainty: the relation of NP arguments to their
predicator now does not extend through various layers of artificial
structural complexity ( XCOMPs).  For VP-topicalization or
extraposition an unbounded long-distance dependency must still be
assumed.  However, as the functional uncertainty path for auxiliaries
is distributed only over the m-structure of the verb complex ((

 ), and does not involve the resolution of
the role of NP arguments, there are in fact differing paths of
functional uncertainty involved.  The dependencies between predicators
and their arguments and auxiliaries and their dependents are thus
neatly factored out. The m-structure corresponding to the matrix VP in
(0) is (1).  The desired flat f-structure resulting from the
usual 

and 

annotations is as in (-1).

Like the f-structure, the m-structure is an attribute-value matrix.
It encodes language-specific information about idiosyncratic
constraints on morphological forms.  The m-structure is not derived
from the f-structure.  Rather, both representations are in
simultaneous correspondence with the c-structure.  The following
(abbreviated) lexical entry exemplifies the pieces of information
needed.  The disjunctive lexical entry for wird `will' in
(1) takes the various combinatory possibilities of auxiliaries
and main verbs into account, and provides the appropriate tense
feature.  For example, it requires that the embedded  VFORM be  BASE,
and that there be no passive involved for a simple future like   wird drehen.  

Features needed only to ensure language particular wellformedness are
no longer unified into the f-structure, cluttering a representation
that is meant to be language independent.  In our analysis, only
features needed for further semantic interpretation, MT, or for the
expression of language universal syntactic generalizations are
represented at f-structure.  For example, morphologically encoded
information like case, gender, or agreement is needed for statements
as to binding, predicate-argument relations, or the determination of
complex clause structures (given that agreement is generally
clause-bounded), and is therefore represented at f-structure.
Wellformedness conditions on adjective inflection or relative pronoun
agreement, however, can now be stated on the m-structure as
idiosyncratic, language particular information which can be ignored
for purposes of MT or semantic interpretation.

Abstract:
This paper focuses on two disparate aspects of German syntax from
  the perspective of parallel grammar development.  As part of a
  cooperative project, we present an innovative approach to
  auxiliaries and multiple genitive NPs in German.  The LFG-based
  implementation presented here avoids unnessary structural complexity
  in the representation of auxiliaries by challenging the traditional
  analysis of auxiliaries as raising verbs.  The approach developed
  for multiple genitive NPs provides a more abstract, language
  independent representation of genitives associated with nominalized
  verbs.  Taken together, the two approaches represent a step towards
  providing uniformly applicable treatments for differing languages,
  thus lightening the burden for machine translation.

Within the cooperative parallel grammar project  PARGRAM
(IMS-Stuttgart, Xerox-Palo Alto, Xerox-Grenoble), the analysis and
representation of structures in the grammars must be viewed from a
more global perspective than that of the individual languages (German,
English, French).  One major goal of  PARGRAM is the development
of broad coverage grammars which are also modular and easy to

clause-bounded), and is therefore represented at f-structure.
Wellformedness conditions on adjective inflection or relative pronoun
agreement, however, can now be stated on the m-structure as
idiosyncratic, language particular information which can be ignored
for purposes of MT or semantic interpretation.

The differing surface realization of genitives within NPs in English
(preverbal NPs, postverbal PPs), French (postverbal PPs), and German
(preverbal NPs, postverbal PPs or NPs), poses a particular challenge
for a parallel grammar development project like  PARGRAM.  In
this paper, we suggest a treatment of multiple genitive NPs which not
only accounts for some restrictions on their distribution within
German, but also allows a language independent (universal)
representation, thus facilitating MT.

In general, the distribution of multiple NPs within NPs is an area of
German syntax which has not received a satisfactory account to date
(e.g., Pollard and Sag (1994), Bhatt (1990), Haider (1988)). In
German, nouns generally have at most one genitive which may occur in
a prenominal or postnominal position adjacent to the noun. Both kinds of
genitives have the same morphological shape. However, nominalizations
that are derived from a transitive verb allow for two genitives, one
in the prenominal, the other in the postnominal position.

The function of a genitive is generally expressed as indicating a
possessor:  POSS within LFG. However, in the case of two
genitives, the assignment of two  POSS values violates the
uniqueness-condition on f-structures and is furthermore insufficient
to distinguish the two differing kinds of genitives.  We therefore
propose the utilization of two functions named  GEN1 and 
  GEN2 in order to avoid association with any specific semantic role.
Furthermore, as genitives in the NP are generally optional, they are
taken to express no governed functions, i.e., they are not
subcategorized for by the noun.  So  GEN1 and  GEN2 are 
semantic functions in LFG on a par with, say, adjuncts. The
 NP rule for German then is (1). 

If the head-noun is not derived from, say, a verb, the single genitive
in either position is interpreted as a possessor. In case of a derived
nominal, however, a genitive is interpreted according to the thematic roles
assigned to the arguments of the verbal base. That means the functions
 GEN1 and sc gen2 have to be linked to the appropriate roles.
Neither of the two functions is in principle restricted to any
specific role. But if both genitives are present they must be 
interpreted according to a thematic role hierarchy.

As (1) shows, if only one genitive is present, its prenominal
interpretation may be as agent or as patient. A postnominal (single)
genitive is interpreted as agent if the head noun is derived from an
intransitive, and as a patient/theme if derived from a transitive.

However, if two genitives occur, as in (1), the prenominal
genitive is restricted to an agent, and the postnominal one to patient. 
This restriction must be encoded at some level, but does not follow
from the distiction between  GEN1 and  GEN2, which are functions
that do not bear any semantic content on their own.

To obtain the correct linking, the argument structure of the verbal
base must be available.  Since MT is based on f-structures within 
  PARGRAM, the argument structure has to be present at this level of
 representation. Nominalization is therefore implemented as a morphologically driven process (lexical rule) which
eliminates  SUBJ and  OBJ from the verb's subcategorization
frame and enters the verb's argument structure into the lexical entry
of the noun.  This yields the optionality of genitives while
preserving the underlying semantics, as shown in (1).  The
association of  GEN1 and  GEN2 then is determined according
to a hierarchical order of arguments (Bresnan, 1995).

This approach also provides a means of handling certain cases of
categorial shift. For instance, in German temporal and conditional
adjuncts may be realized as PPs dominating an NP headed by a deverbal
noun. English does not have this option, but employs an adjunct-clause
instead. Here, the  GEN1 and  GEN2 functions of the German
f-structure have to be related correctly to the  SUBJ and 
  OBJ functions of the English f-structure.

Here the linking of the  GEN1 and  GEN2 functions to the
appropriate thematic role in the German f-structure drives the
transfer of these functions to the  SUBJ and  OBJ functions
of the English f-structure.
