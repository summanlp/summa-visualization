This paper focuses on two disparate aspects of German syntax from
  the perspective of parallel grammar development.  As part of a
  cooperative project, we present an innovative approach to
  auxiliaries and multiple genitive NPs in German.  The LFG-based
  implementation presented here avoids unnessary structural complexity
  in the representation of auxiliaries by challenging the traditional
  analysis of auxiliaries as raising verbs.  The approach developed
  for multiple genitive NPs provides a more abstract, language
  independent representation of genitives associated with nominalized
  verbs.  Taken together, the two approaches represent a step towards
  providing uniformly applicable treatments for differing languages,
  thus lightening the burden for machine translation.
