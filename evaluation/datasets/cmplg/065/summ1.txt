Dependency grammar is usually interpreted as equivalent to a strict form
of X-bar theory that forbids the stacking of nodes of the same bar
level (e.g., 


immediately dominating 


with the same
head).  But adequate accounts of one-anaphora and of the
semantics of multiple modifiers require such stacking and accordingly
argue against dependency grammar. Dependency grammar can be salvaged by
reinterpreting its claims about phrase structure, so that modifiers map
onto binary-branching X-bar trees rather than ``flat'' ones.
