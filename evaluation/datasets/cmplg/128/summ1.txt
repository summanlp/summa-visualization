Grice's maxims of conversation [Grice 1975] 
are framed as directives to be followed
by a speaker of the language.
This paper argues that, when considered from the point of view
of natural language generation, such a characterisation is rather misleading,
and that the desired behaviour falls out quite naturally if we
view language generation as a goal-oriented process.  We argue this
position with particular regard to the generation of referring
expressions.
