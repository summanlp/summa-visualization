A German language model for the Xerox HMM tagger is presented.  This
model's performance is compared with two other German taggers with
partial parameter re-estimation and full adaption of parameters from
pre-tagged corpora. The ambiguity types resolved by this model are
analysed and compared to ambiguity types of English and French.
Finally, the model's error types are described. I argue that although
the overall performance of these models for German is comparable to
results for English and French, a more exact analysis demonstrates
important differences in the types of disambiguation involved for German.
