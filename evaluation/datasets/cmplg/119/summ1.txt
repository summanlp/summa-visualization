We present an argument for construction grammars
based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle
(a formal version of the Ockham Razor). The argument consists in
using linguistic and computational evidence in setting up a
formal model, and then applying the MDL principle to prove
its superiority with respect to alternative models.
We show that construction-based representations are
at least an order of magnitude more compact that the corresponding
lexicalized representations of the same linguistic data.
The result is significant for our understanding of the relationship
between syntax and semantics, and consequently for choosing
NLP architectures. For instance, whether the
processing should proceed in a pipeline from syntax to semantics to
pragmatics, and whether all linguistic information should be
combined in a set of constraints. From a broader perspective,
this paper does not only argue for
a certain model of processing, but also provides a methodology for
determining advantages of different approaches to NLP.
