We present some variations affecting the association measure and
thresholding on a technique for learning Selectional Restrictions from
on-line corpora. It uses a wide-coverage noun taxonomy and a
statistical measure to generalize the appropriate semantic
classes. Evaluation measures for the Selectional Restrictions learning
task are discussed. Finally, an experimental evaluation of these
variations is reported.
