Current work in surface realization concentrates on the use
of general, abstract algorithms that interpret large, reversible grammars.
Only little attention has been paid so far to 
the many small and simple applications that require coverage of
a small sublanguage at different degrees of sophistication. 
The system TG/2 described in this paper
can be smoothly integrated with deep generation processes,
it integrates canned text, templates, and context-free rules into a
single formalism, it allows for both textual and tabular output, and
it can be parameterized according to linguistic preferences.
These features are based on suitably restricted production system
techniques and on a generic backtracking regime.
