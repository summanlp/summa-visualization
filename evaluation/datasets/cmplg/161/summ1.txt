In this paper we present a unification-based lexical platform designed for
highly inflected languages (like Roman ones). A formalism is proposed for
encoding a lemma-based lexical source, well suited for linguistic
generalizations. From this source, we automatically generate an allomorph
indexed dictionary, adequate for efficient processing.  A set of software
tools have been implemented around this formalism: access libraries,
morphological processors, etc.
