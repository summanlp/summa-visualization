This paper compares a qualitative reasoning model of
translation with a quantitative statistical model.
We consider these models within the context of two hypothetical
speech translation systems, starting with a logic-based design
and pointing out which of its characteristics are best
preserved or eliminated in moving to the second,
quantitative design. The quantitative language and
translation models are based on relations between lexical heads of
phrases. Statistical parameters for structural dependency, lexical
transfer, and linear order are used to select a
set of implicit relations between words in a source utterance,
a corresponding set of relations between target language words,
and the most likely translation of the original utterance.
