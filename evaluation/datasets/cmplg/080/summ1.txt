I describe a compiler and development environment for
feature-augmented two-level morphology rules integrated into a full
NLP system. The compiler is optimized for a class of languages
including many or most European ones, and for rapid development and
debugging of descriptions of new languages.  The key design decision
is to compose morphophonological and morphosyntactic information, but
not the lexicon, when compiling the description.  This results in
typical compilation times of about a minute, and has allowed a
reasonably full, feature-based description of French inflectional
morphology to be developed in about a month by a linguist new to the
system.
