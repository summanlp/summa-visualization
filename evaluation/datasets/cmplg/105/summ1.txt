A comparison was made of vectors derived by using ordinary co-occurrence
statistics from large text corpora and
of vectors derived by measuring the inter-word distances in dictionary
definitions.
The precision of word sense disambiguation by
using co-occurrence vectors from the 1987 Wall Street Journal
(20M total words) was higher than that by using
distance vectors from the Collins English Dictionary
( head words +  definition words).
However, other experimental results suggest that distance vectors
contain some different semantic information from co-occurrence vectors.
