We present a model of NLP in which ontology and context are
directly included in a grammar. The model is based on the
concept of construction, consisting of a set of
features of form, a set of semantic and pragmatic
conditions describing its application context,
and a description of its meaning.
In this model ontology is embedded into the grammar;
e.g. the hierarchy  of
np constructions is based on the corresponding ontology.
Ontology is also used in defining contextual parameters;
e.g. 

.
A parser based on this model allowed us to
build a set of dialog understanding systems that include
an on-line calendar, a banking machine, and an insurance quote
system. The proposed approach is an alternative
to the standard "pipeline"
design of morphology-syntax-semantics-pragmatics; the account of
meaning conforms to our intuitions about compositionality,
but there is no homomorphism from syntax to semantics.
