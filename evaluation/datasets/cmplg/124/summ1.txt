We introduce  

 ,
a monadic second-order language for reasoning
about trees which characterizes the strongly Context-Free Languages in the
sense that a set of finite trees is definable in 

iff it is (modulo a
projection) a Local Set--the set of derivation trees generated by a CFG.
This provides a flexible approach to establishing language-theoretic complexity
results for formalisms that are based on systems of well-formedness constraints
on trees.  We demonstrate this technique by sketching two such results for
Government and Binding Theory.  First, we show that free-indexation,
the mechanism assumed to mediate a variety of 
agreement and binding relationships in GB, is not definable in 

and
therefore not enforcible by CFGs.  Second, we show how, in spite of this
limitation, a reasonably complete GB account of English can be defined in

 .
Consequently, the language licensed by that account is strongly context-free.
We illustrate some of the issues involved in establishing this result by
looking at the definition, in 

 ,
of chains.  The limitations of this
definition provide some insight into the types of natural linguistic principles
that correspond to higher levels of language complexity.  We close with some
speculation on the possible significance of these results for generative
linguistics.
