An approach for the automatic acquisition of
linguistic knowledge from unstructured data is presented. The acquired
knowledge is represented in the lexical knowledge representation
language DATR. A set of transformation rules that establish inheritance
relationships and a default-inference algorithm make up the basis components
of the system. Since the overall approach is not restricted to a special
domain, the heuristic inference strategy uses criteria to evaluate
the quality of a DATR theory, where different domains may require
different criteria. The system is applied to the linguistic learning task
of German noun inflection.
