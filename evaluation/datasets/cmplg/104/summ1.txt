This paper discusses the lexicographical concept of lexical
 functions () and their potential exploitation in the development of a machine translation lexicon designed to handle
collocations. We show how lexical functions can be thought to reflect
cross-linguistic meaning concepts for collocational structures and
their translational equivalents, and therefore suggest themselves as
some kind of language-independent semantic primitives from which
 translation strategies can be developed.
