This paper describes work performed withing the CRATER (Corpus
Resources And Terminology ExtRaction,
MLAP-93/20) project, funded by the Commission of the European
Communities.  In particular, it addresses the issue of adapting the
Xerox Tagger to Spanish in order to tag the Spanish version of the ITU
(International Telecommunications Union) corpus.  The model implemented
by this tagger is briefly presented along with some modifications
performed on it in order to use some parameters not probabilistically
estimated.  Initial decisions, like the tagset, the lexicon and the
training corpus are also discussed.  Finally, results are presented and
the benefits of the mixed model justified.
