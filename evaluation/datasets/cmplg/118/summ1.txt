An experiment designed to explore the relationship between tagging accuracy
and the nature of the tagset is described, using corpora in English, French
and Swedish. In particular, the question of internal versus external criteria
for tagset design is considered, with the general conclusion that external
(linguistic) criteria should be followed. Some problems associated with
tagging unknown words in inflected languages are briefly considered.
