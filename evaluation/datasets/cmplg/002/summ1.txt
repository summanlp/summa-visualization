Why should computers interpret language incrementally?  In recent years
psycholinguistic evidence for incremental interpretation has become more and
more compelling, suggesting that humans perform semantic interpretation before
constituent boundaries, possibly word by word. However, possible computational
applications have received less attention.  In this paper we consider various
potential applications, in particular graphical interaction and dialogue. We
then review the theoretical and computational tools available for mapping from
fragments of sentences to fully scoped semantic representations. Finally, we
tease apart the relationship between dynamic semantics and incremental
interpretation.
