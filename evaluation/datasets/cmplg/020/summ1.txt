One of the problems in part-of-speech tagging of real-word texts is
   that of unknown to the lexicon words. In , a   technique for fully unsupervised statistical acquisition of rules which
  guess possible parts-of-speech for unknown words was proposed.  One of
  the over-simplification assumed by this learning technique was the
  acquisition of morphological rules which obey only simple concatenative
  regularities of the main word with an affix. In this paper we extend
  this technique to the non-concatenative cases of suffixation and assess
  the gain in the performance.
