The use of terms from natural and social scientific
titles and abstracts is studied from the perspective
of sublanguages and their specialized dictionaries.
Different notions of sublanguage distinctiveness are explored.
Objective methods for separating hard and soft sciences are suggested based
on measures of sublanguage use, dictionary characteristics, and sublanguage
distinctiveness.
Abstracts were automatically classified with a high
degree of accuracy by using a formula that considers the
degree of uniqueness of terms in each sublanguage.
This may prove useful for text filtering or information retrieval systems.
