The Spoken Language Translator (SLT) is a prototype for practically
useful systems capable of translating continuous spoken language
within restricted domains. The prototype system translates air travel
(ATIS) queries from spoken English to spoken Swedish and to French. It
is constructed, with as few modifications as possible, from existing
pieces of speech and language processing software.
The speech recognizer and language understander are connected by a
fairly conventional pipelined N-best interface.  This paper focuses on
the ways in which the language processor makes intelligent use of the
sentence hypotheses delivered by the recognizer. These ways include
(1) producing modified hypotheses to reflect the possible presence of
repairs in the uttered word sequence; (2) fast parsing with a version
of the grammar automatically specialized to the more frequent
constructions in the training corpus; and (3) allowing syntactic and
semantic factors to interact with acoustic ones in the choice of a
meaning structure for translation, so that the acoustically preferred
hypothesis is not always selected even if it is within linguistic
coverage.
