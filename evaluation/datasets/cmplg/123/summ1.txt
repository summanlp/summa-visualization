We prove a theorem stating that any semantics can be encoded as a
compositional semantics, which means that, essentially, the standard
definition of compositionality is formally vacuous. We then show that when
compositional semantics is required to be "systematic"
(that is, the meaning
function cannot be arbitrary, but must belong to some class),
it is possible to
distinguish between compositional and non-compositional semantics.
As a result, we believe that the paper clarifies the
concept of compositionality and opens a possibility of making systematic
formal comparisons of different systems of grammars.
