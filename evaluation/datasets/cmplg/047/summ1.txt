Issues in sentence categorization according to language is
  fundamental for NLP, especially in document processing. In fact,
  with the growing amount of multilingual text corpus data becoming
  available, sentence categorization, leading to multilingual text
  structure, opens a wide range of applications in multilingual text
  analysis such as information retrieval or preprocessing of
  multilingual syntactic parser.
The major difficulties in sentence categorization are convergence
  and textual errors. Convergence since dealing with short entries
  involve discarding languages from few clues. Textual errors since
  documents coming from different electronic ways may contain spelling
  and grammatical errors as well as character recognition errors
  generated by OCR.
We describe here an approach to sentence categorization which has
  the originality to be based on natural properties of languages with
  no training set dependency. The implementation is fast, small,
  robust and textual errors tolerant. Tested for french, english,
  spanish and german discrimination, the system gives very interesting
  results, achieving in one test 99.4% correct assignments on
  real sentences.
The resolution power is based on grammatical words (not the most
  common words) and alphabet. Having the grammatical words and the
  alphabet of each language at its disposal, the system computes for
  each of them its likelihood to be selected. The name of the language
  having the optimum likelihood will tag the sentence -- but non
  resolved ambiguities will be maintained.  We will discuss the
  reasons which lead us to use these linguistic facts and present
  several directions to improve the system's classification
  performance.
Categorization sentences with linguistic properties shows that
  difficult problems have sometimes simple solutions.
