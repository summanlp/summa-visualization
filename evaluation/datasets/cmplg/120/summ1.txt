This paper describes the author's implementation of a parser aimed at
reproducing,  in a computationally explicit system,  the
constraints of a particular psycholinguistic model (Gorrell in
press). In Gorrell's  model, ``unconscious'' garden paths
may be processed via the addition of structural relations to a
monotone increasing set at the point of disambiguation, but there is
no discussion as to how the parser decides which relations to
add. We model this decision as a search for a node in the tree at
which an explicitly defined parsing operation,  tree-lowering
may be applied. With reference to English and Japanese processing
data, we show  the importance of this search for  empirical
adequacy of the  psycholinguistic model.
