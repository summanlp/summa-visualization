This squib examines the role of limited attention in a theory of
discourse structure and proposes a model of attentional state that
relates current hierarchical theories of discourse structure to
empirical evidence about human discourse processing capabilities.
First, I present examples that are not predicted by Grosz and Sidner's
stack model of attentional state. Then I consider an alternative model
of attentional state, the cache model, which accounts for the
examples, and which makes particular processing predictions.  Finally
I suggest a number of ways that future research could distinguish the
predictions of the cache model and the stack model.
