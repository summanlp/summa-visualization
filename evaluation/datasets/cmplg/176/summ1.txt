Dialect groupings can be discovered objectively and automatically by
cluster analysis of phonetic transcriptions such as those found in a
linguistic atlas.  The first step in the analysis, the computation of
linguistic distance between each pair of sites, can be computed as
Levenshtein distance between phonetic strings.  This correlates
closely with the much more laborious technique of determining and
counting isoglosses, and is more accurate than the more familiar
metric of computing Hamming distance based on whether vocabulary
entries match.  In the actual clustering step, traditional
agglomerative clustering works better than the top-down technique of
partitioning around medoids.  When agglomerative clustering of
phonetic string comparison distances is applied to Gaelic,
reasonable dialect boundaries are obtained, corresponding to national
and (within Ireland) provincial boundaries.
