One of the most important questions in applied NLG is what benefits
(or `value-added', in business-speak) NLG technology offers over
template-based approaches.  Despite the importance of this question
to the applied NLG community, however, it has not been discussed
much in the research NLG community, which I think is a pity.  In this paper,
I try to summarize the issues involved and recap current thinking on this
topic.  My goal is not to answer this question (I don't think we know enough
to be able to do so), but rather to increase the visibility of this issue
in the research community, in the hope of getting some input and ideas
on this very important question.  I conclude with a list of specific
research areas I would like to see more work in, because I think they would
increase the `value-added' of NLG over templates.
