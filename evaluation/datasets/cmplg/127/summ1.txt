Expectations about the correlation of cue phrases, the duration of
unfilled pauses and the structuring of spoken discourse are framed in
light of Grosz and Sidner's theory of discourse and are tested for a
directions-giving dialogue.  The results suggest that cue phrase and
discourse structuring tasks may align, and show a correlation for
pause length and some of the modifications that speakers can make to
discourse structure.
