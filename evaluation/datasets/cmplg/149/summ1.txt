We present a metagrammatical formalism, generic rules, 
to give a default interpretation to grammar 
rules. Our formalism introduces a process of dynamic binding 
interfacing the level of pure grammatical knowledge representation and 
the parsing level. We present an approach to 
non-constituent coordination within categorial grammars, and 
reformulate it as a generic rule. This reformulation is context-free 
parsable and reduces drastically the search space associated to the 
parsing task for such phenomena.
