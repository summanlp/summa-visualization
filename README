summa visualization module
===========================

This module intends to provide a visualization of the graph built by summa for
producing the results.

Usage:

    >>> text = """Automatic summarization is the process of reducing a text document with a
    computer program in order to create a summary that retains the most important points
    of the original document. As the problem of information overload has grown, and as
    the quantity of data has increased, so has interest in automatic summarization.
    Technologies that can make a coherent summary take into account variables such as
    length, writing style and syntax. An example of the use of summarization technology
    is search engines such as Google. Document summarization is another."""

    >>> from visualization.export import gexf_export
    >>> gexf_export(text, path="graph.gexf")

This uses version 0.1.0 of the summarization module and works in Python 2.7.
